Here, a gown that resembled a quivering cloud of blush-pink feathers; there, sumptuously draped, Watteau-esque garments of dusty rose and red silk. For the finale, lightweight, angel-sleeved plissé dresses in tart hues — raspberry, tangerine — swept through, the models adorned with matching floral headpieces made of chrysanthemums and orchids. There was little point in overthinking the assortment of references on display: Molly Bloom and the court of Versailles, Ziggy Stardust and classical mythology among them.

I still marvel at the hot pastrami on rye at Langer’s in Los Angeles, which Nora Ephron called the finest hot pastrami sandwich in the world. I’ve devoured heroes at Lioni in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn: capicola, prosciutto, olive loaf, fresh mozzarella, chopped tomatoes, a little drizzle of balsamic. That’s “a well-trained hero,” according to the restaurant’s menu. The owners call it the Angelo Dundee. I love a Nicky Special at Defonte’s in Red Hook, heavy on the fried eggplant, extra hot salad on top.

For nearly 60 years, she has lived in the former French Concession, a leafy part of Shanghai whose name itself carries the humiliation of China’s biggest trade war.

She tells of her Southern childhood and an idiosyncratic acting career. CATWOMAN By Sarah J. Maas. Read by Julia Whelan. (Listening Library.) In this outing, part of the DC Icons series, Selina Kyle, a.k.a. Catwoman, has free range in Gotham with Batman off on an important mission. She deploys her claws for good and evil. A POLAROID GUY IN A SNAPCHAT WORLD By David Spade. Read by the author. (Audible.) The “Saturday Night Live” alum reflects on the challenges of dating in his 50s, including how you break up with someone over text. In his own goofy voice, Spade’s is a journey into the travails of middle age from someone who is still trying to pick up young women. THE COMING STORM By Michael Lewis. Read by the author. (Audible.) The blockbuster nonfiction storyteller offers his look at the science of weather prediction and how the government handles information about the storms on their way. Lewis wrote this piece as one of four original works for Audible, and it shows off his ability to humanize and make fascinating even the most arcane data. A ROOM WITH A VIEW By E. M. Forster.

2018-08-07,One Wine Glass to Rule Them All,"For a wine critic’s personal stemware line, one size fits all.","Choosing stemware for every varietal does not interest the English wine critic Jancis Robinson. Her line includes a single mouth-blown wine glass with a generous bowl and a gently tapering tulip shape that she says can be used to serve anything: Champagne, white and red wines, sherries and ports. The glass holds a good 15.5 ounces, but a drinkable four ounces will fill it to the widest part. It’s comfortable to grasp, to swirl and to drink from. (There’s a companion stemless water glass in the same shape.) Yet when it comes to decanters, Ms. Robinson does not think one size fits all. There’s a broad-based young wine decanter that will expose the liquid to more air and soften it, and a narrower one for older wines shaped to help retain the fragile fruit and aroma. The line — designed by Richard Brendon of London — is lead-free and dishwasher safe.",Food,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/07/dining/wine-glass-jancis-robinson.html

But his $20 presentation for dinner at the Polo Bar is a far cry from a ballpark frank. The hot dogs — thick, juicy and with good snap — arrive on a board with condiments in silver cups, nestled in split brioche buns and topped with ketchup, mustard, sauerkraut, chopped onions, relish and a parade of pickled jalapeño slices like buttons on a cardigan. They’re made from a blend of Colorado beef and Australian Wagyu. There is a somewhat limited supply, but they should be on the menu at Chicago’s RL Restaurant and New York’s Polo Bar throughout the fall.

They come brightly colored in one of three shapes (there’s Gnome Without Hat, Gnome With Hole and Gnome Sleeping) and are “quasi-functional”; each is able to hold small objects on its narrow shelf. “We became interested in the history of the lawn,” says Kolb, explaining that they created the inaugural run last year for a yard-themed art exhibition he organized in Brooklyn with friends. “There’s a lot that’s been written on the subject,” he says. “From the 18th century, the lawn moved from agrarian landscape to one that privileged pleasure over productivity.” Plus, Diamantopoulou, born and raised in Greece, is perpetually intrigued by kitschy Americana, a category to which contemporary gnomes often belong. “I refer to them as guh-nomes,” she adds, laughing. “I’d never heard anyone speak about them. I kept thinking that was what they were called.” $298, mocastore.org — HILARY MOSS",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/10/t-magazine/abstract-gnomes-japanese-breads-editors-picks.html

With the right wet suit, you no longer need the sun, and so adventure athletes looking to escape oversaturated beach towns have over the past decades made surf spots out of less hospitable coasts: Iceland, Russia’s Kamchatka Peninsula and even the Arctic. Perhaps more surprising is that, as a burgeoning cadre of enthusiasts who happen to live in landlocked areas are proving, you don’t even need sea.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/13/t-magazine/freshwater-surfing.html

2018-08-20,The Russia Fun-House Mirror,This week I’ll try to make some arguments you might not have heard before. ,"John Brennan, a former C.I.A. director and a self-declared supporter of the Communist Party candidate for president in 1976, claims that he knows that the Trump campaign colluded with the Russians. To my mind, in making this claim, he provided ample evidence of why he should not possess a security clearance. Because if he does actually know this — and if his knowledge is based on information gained through the use of his clearance — then he is guilty of a grave security breach. If not, well, then he’s just a windbag. But one who is coddled and promoted, if not taken totally seriously, by Trump haters. Which makes me wonder when the progressive left got comfortable with the national security state and its spies. It’s just such contortions — on the left and on the right — that have me thinking differently about politics.",Opinion,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/20/opinion/john-brennan-clearance-trump-russia.html

2018-08-21,New & Noteworthy,"A selection of books published this week; plus, a peek at what our colleagues around the newsroom are reading.","THE CARRYING By Ada Limón. (Milkweed, $22.) Limón has a novelistic knack for scene, and the narrative lyrics in this remarkable collection, her fifth, could stand as compressed stories about anxiety and the body. “On my way to the fertility clinic, / I pass five dead animals,” one poem states. “What if, instead of carrying / a child, I am supposed to carry grief?” A MEMORY OF THE FUTURE By Elizabeth Spires. (Norton, $26.95.) Sprinkled with philosophical inquiries and Zen koans like that of the title, Spires’s contemplative sixth collection opens with delicious wordplay: A poem called “Pome” riffs on the French word for apple to imagine verse as fruitlike and alive. “Common as an apple. Or / more rare. A quince or pear,” Spires writes. “Peer in and watch it / change and darken as pomes will do.” SURGE By Etel Adnan. (Nightboat, paper, $12.95.) “In perception, redemption,” Adnan declares in this assemblage of mystical, metaphysical ideas and aphorisms, often in conversation with the dead. “We have to say yes to that fate,” she writes of mortality, “and it’s hard, the hardest.” IF YOU HAVE TO GO By Katie Ford. (Graywolf, paper, $16.) Faith and doubt — in love, in God — course through Ford’s powerful fourth book, anchored by a long sonnet sequence about the end of a marriage. “It comes, then it goes, then it never was.” FEELD By Jos Charles. (Milkweed, paper, $16.) Charles, a trans woman, turns to a sort of Chaucerian-texting hybrid in an inspired effort to find language as unstable as her experience. “Bieng a tran is a queery of crisees,” she writes, “& r brused handes r manie.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/21/books/review/new-noteworthy-matt-flegenheimer.html

2018-08-22,How the Trump Administration Is Remaking the Courts,Thanks to ruthless discipline — and a plan long in the making — the G.O.P is carrying out a sweeping transformation of the federal judiciary.,"Donald F. McGahn, the White House counsel, stood in the gilded ballroom of Washington’s Mayflower Hotel last November to address the annual meeting of the Federalist Society. He seemed humbled, even a bit awed to be delivering the Barbara K. Olson Memorial lecture, named after the conservative lawyer who died in the Sept. 11 attacks. Noting some of the legal giants who gave the Olson lecture in years past, McGahn reflected, “You hear names like Scalia, Roberts and Gorsuch and then me; one of those names really is different than the rest.” Unlike previous speakers — to say nothing of many of those to whom he was now speaking — McGahn, himself a member of the Federalist Society, hadn’t attended an Ivy League law school; he went to Widener University, a “second tier” law school in Pennsylvania. He had never held a tenured professorship or boasted an appellate practice, much less a judgeship, that required him to think deeply about weighty constitutional issues; he specialized in the comparably mundane and technical field of campaign finance and election law. “But here we are,” McGahn said to the audience, almost apologetically. In 2015, Donald Trump hired McGahn to be the lawyer for his long-shot presidential campaign. Then, after Trump shockingly won the election, he tapped McGahn, who had proved his talent and loyalty during the campaign, to be White House counsel. Trump, in other words, had made McGahn’s wildest dreams come true. Now, McGahn told the Federalist Society, Trump was going to make their wildest dreams come true, too.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/22/magazine/trump-remaking-courts-judiciary.html
2018-08-22,When the Supreme Court Lurches Right,What happens when the Supreme Court becomes significantly more conservative than the public? ,"In 1957, Robert A. Dahl, a father of modern political science, published a canonical article about the Supreme Court’s “most peculiar position” in American democracy. “Much of the legitimacy of the Court’s decisions rests upon the fiction that it is not a political institution but exclusively a legal one,” Dahl wrote. And yet, “from time to time its members decide cases where legal criteria are not in any realistic sense adequate to the task.” These decisions, among the court’s most momentous, turned on vague or ambiguous words in the Constitution, like “establishment of religion” and “due process of law,” with precedent and expert opinions on both sides. By making these rulings, the court cast itself as a “national policymaker” — and in so doing raised a difficult question: When should the justices, unelected figures in robes, reflect majority will and when should they stand for “Right or Justice” so as to protect minorities from tyranny by the majority?",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/22/magazine/when-the-supreme-court-lurches-right.html

Seeing the industry “behind the scenes led me to be interested in trying it for myself,” she says of designing clothes. Last Saturday, Sohn’s friends gathered in the Laurel Canyon backyard of the textile designer Heather Taylor for drinks, dinner and a chance to see the pieces up close.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/22/t-magazine/dinner-party-edible-flowers-jeana-sohn.html

Morton continued, “As soon as I realized the mistake, I started studying art, but it was already 1965, and I had a naval officer husband, three children and a house in a middle-class neighborhood in Norfolk, Virginia.” She summarized her life story, with a winking ironic detachment, as a “feminist classic” and then went on to list some of her accomplishments: “I got a B.F.A. and an M.F.A. I learned to use power tools and to know the difference between needing help and just thinking I did. I got a teaching job in Philadelphia. I moved to a loft in N.Y.C.

There was another publisher, Scholastic, tasked with introducing the book and the wizarding world to American children, and soon enough, across the country there were young readers, and more than a few older ones, clamoring for more.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/29/books/review/harry-potter-20th-anniversary.html

That call, part of a successful, if highly improbable, seven-month undercover operation Stallworth conducted into the Klan’s local chapter, has been memorialized on film by John David Washington, who plays Stallworth in this summer’s much lauded adaptation by Spike Lee of Stallworth’s memoir, “Black Klansman” (retitled for the movie as “BlacKkKlansman”). But Stallworth’s own performance — as a black-hating white guy eager to defend the Aryan race — required some quick-witted improvisation of his own. “Undercover work is nothing more than acting,” Stallworth says. “The only difference is you don’t have a Spike Lee to say ‘Cut! Move on to the next scene.’ And there’s no danger that the person you’re talking to is going to pull a gun on you and threaten to kill you.
