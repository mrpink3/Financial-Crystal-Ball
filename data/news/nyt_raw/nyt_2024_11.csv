2024-11-07,‘Bird’ Review: In Search of Safety,Barry Keoghan and Franz Rogowski star in a film about a preteen girl who longs for a stability she’s never experienced.,"Good parents are a rarity in Andrea Arnold’s movies. Instead, they tend to be neglectful and preoccupied, often for solid reasons: Arnold tells stories of working-class families, mostly British, mostly struggling to get by, mostly the offspring of parents who are, themselves, distracted and uninterested in their children’s lives. An early short film of Arnold’s, “Wasp,” has a mother locking her four children in the car while she tries to woo an old boyfriend in a bar. One of her best movies, “Fish Tank,” features a mother who punishes her daughter by telling her she should have gone through with her planned abortion instead of giving birth.

For instance, if your host mentions that the walls of his house happened to be lined with metal, you should immediately feign a headache and split before he closes the front door. If the windows in his house look too small even for a child to squeeze through, you should also exit. And if there’s also a framed image of hell on a wall, you should definitely conk him on his head and run. That said, if the host is played by Hugh Grant, you may want to stick around.

Set in 1985 and based on Claire Keegan’s 2021 novel, it is a story about how people create and maintain control and the many shades of complicity that result.

(Its leaves are also edible.) Known in Peru by its Quechua name, kiwicha, it was domesticated by Andean peoples some 3,000 years ago and later became a source of sustenance for the Incas and their contemporaries. (A different variety of amaranth was grown by the Aztecs of Mexico.)

The Sri Lankan lotus farmer was in his late 40s, with dark, leathery skin, a graying soul patch and lips stained red from betel nut. He placed his phone in the branches and gestured to me to remove my shoes. The grass felt like rubber under my feet on that February morning. Mud oozed between my toes. “Pankaja,” I murmured to myself, “mud born.” It is one of over 40 words for the sacred lotus flower (Nelumbo nucifera) in Sanskrit. I rolled my corduroys up to my knees and we began to wade into the lake, which Asoka, whose full name is Y.G.W. Dissinayake, had rented for cultivation. The rising sun suffused the thin mist that hung over the water. We soon stood in several inches of soft mud and murky water, surrounded by a colony of lotuses. There were calyxes of faded pink, others in full bloom, with yellowish-white interiors and petals of translucent brightness, sheltered by broad, nodding leaves and curled, elliptical buds. Most beguiling of all was the fruiting receptacle. It looked like something that a spacecraft might have jettisoned as it breached the Earth’s atmosphere — a magical cup of unbelievable hardiness in whose waxy surface the beanlike seeds of the lotus lay embedded, with the power to fruit even after a thousand years.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/14/t-magazine/lotus-flowers-sri-lanka.html

Wanderers of its peaks, valleys and dunes might miss the Protea nana, also known as the skaamblom, or “shy flower,” because its bell-shaped blooms advance downward into the brush, but there are plenty of other species to see. (The name “protea” comes from the shape-shifting Greek god Proteus.) There’s the Pink Mink, whose petals are tipped with black hairs; the spiky-soft pincushion protea, with its dome of protruding styles; and the King protea, characterized by an oversize inflorescence featuring a ring of bracts surrounding an orblike grouping of velvety florets.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/14/t-magazine/proteas-south-africa-symbol.html

According to Hindu teachings, marigolds embody purity, strength and new beginnings, which means that they feature in rituals of all kinds, from political rallies to sacred festivals to weddings. In cities and towns across India, vendors display them heaped into small mountains or strung into ropes, which are used to adorn the necks of newlyweds or to embellish ceremonial altars.

That’s especially true in Papua New Guinea, where the scale and diversity of orchids holds a mirror to the country itself, which is home to some 850 distinct languages and about as many tribes. More than 3,800 species of orchids have been identified on the island of New Guinea, the eastern half of which comprises most of Papua New Guinea, but Mary Gerritsen, the president of the California-based Orchid Conservation Alliance and a frequent leader of orchid-spotting trips to Papua New Guinea, estimates that there could be more than a thousand species yet to be documented.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/14/t-magazine/orchids-papua-new-guinea.html
2024-11-14,How the World’s Most Expensive Spice Is Grown,A glimpse at Kashmir’s saffron harvest.,"Its vibrant purple petals notwithstanding, the saffron flower (Crocus sativus) is valued primarily for what hides beneath those petals: tiny, fiery orange stamens that, once plucked and processed, become the world’s most expensive spice, one that adds sweet flavor and deep golden color to dishes as culinarily disparate as Spanish paella, South Asian pulao and Swedish St. Lucia buns. Known botanically as a triploid owing to its three sets of chromosomes, the saffron crocus can neither grow wild nor reproduce without human intervention. Instead the plant must be propagated and harvested manually, a laborious undertaking that Bronze Age Greeks are believed to have pioneered and that helps account for its price. Today saffron is grown in a latitudinal belt that runs from the Mediterranean to South Asia, with Iran currently contributing about 85 percent of the global supply. But saffron from Kashmir is arguably the most highly prized, says Sana Javeri-Kadri, whose seven-year-old Oakland, Calif.-based spice business, Diaspora Spice Co., sources its inventory from a small family farm in the Kashmiri town of Pampore, where the flowers have been cultivated since at least the 12th century. Harvested between late October and early November, the saffron there grows alongside apricots and almonds in particularly porous soil that’s fed by nutrient-rich snowmelt all spring. The result is an extra-potent crop redolent of almonds and honey that’s hand-processed, with each individual stamen massaged to bring its natural oils to the surface. The beauty of the valley during the saffron bloom, she says, is almost otherworldly. “The light is buttery yellow, the leaves of the fruit trees are bright orange and the ground is blanketed in purple flowers,” says Javeri-Kadri, who has attended Pampore’s fall harvest for three years running. “I’ve never seen those colors together in nature before. It’s stunning.”",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/14/t-magazine/saffron-kashmir.html

The majority of them are growing Jasminum grandiflorum, a lacy vine with delicate white flowers that typically bloom between June and December and yield 90 percent of the country’s jasmine crop: roughly 2,500 tons of blossoms a year. The flowers are handpicked at dawn and then placed in solvent-filled extraction tanks where the liquid is distilled, steamed and cooled overnight before re-emerging as a waxlike paste that’s then shipped to perfumeries around the world.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/14/t-magazine/egypt-jasmine-perfume.html

For several weeks between August and November, depending on the intensity of the year’s monsoons, farmers and other locals, mostly women, wade through murky shallows at dawn to collect the day-blooming Nymphaea nouchali and the night-blooming Nymphaea rubra, the two varieties most commonly found in Africa and Asia. There are roughly 85 species in the waterlily family, Nymphaeaceae, native to temperate and tropical climates around the world and descendants of the planet’s oldest flowering plants. Fossilized seeds found in northern Japan in 1997 are believed to be about 85 million years old. In ancient Egypt, pharaohs, including King Tutankhamen (circa 1341-23 B.C.), were buried with blue waterlilies.

2024-11-21,Help! I Was Denied Boarding While Pregnant.,"The policy of La Compagnie, which was not posted online, required a doctor’s note for anyone more than 28 weeks pregnant. A last-minute midwife’s letter would not do.","On the evening of July 19, six members of my family were set to fly La Compagnie, a French business-class-only airline, from Newark Liberty International Airport to Nice, France, for a long-planned trip that included the Paris Olympics. When my husband and I arrived at the airport, the other four had already gone through security. The La Compagnie agent congratulated me on my (obvious) pregnancy and asked how far along I was. I answered truthfully: 28 weeks and a day. She said I needed a letter from my doctor saying I was OK to fly. But every doctor and midwife I had spoken to about the trip reassured me it was safe, including the midwife I saw the day before at my 28-week checkup. Even though she was attending someone else’s labor that evening, she managed to send a letter, first through a patient portal and then via email directly to La Compagnie, along with her provider identifier number and, when the staff insisted, a photo of her hospital ID. But even after I did everything they asked, the agent told me the crew had determined I could not board. The La Compagnie desk was closing for the night, and the agent gave me a number to call to rebook. But with no guarantee I would be able to fly, even if there were seats available in the coming days, we booked a flight for the next evening on Air France for about $6,560 each — a steep increase from our $3,530 La Compagnie tickets. La Compagnie offered to return the original $3,530 each, but I believe they were wrong to deny us boarding and should compensate us for the cost of the last-minute flight instead. Can you help?

The 1939 film with Judy Garland, in particular, is so embedded in the American cinematic DNA that it’s inspired everyone from Martin Scorsese to David Lynch, Spike Lee and John Waters, who once called (accurately!) the wicked witch “every bad little boy’s and girl’s dream of notoriety and style.”",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/21/movies/wicked-review.html
