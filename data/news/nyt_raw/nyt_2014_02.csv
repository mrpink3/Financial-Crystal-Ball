A spokesman for Harris County’s top elected official, Judge Ed Emmett, said the dome’s inclusion in the register “would have no practical effect on the county’s ability to either repurpose the Astrodome for future use or to demolish it.” ",U.S.,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/01/us/texas-historic-status-for-astrodome.html

2014-02-01,Bloomberg Picked to Be Climate Envoy,"Michael R. Bloomberg, the billionaire former mayor of New York City, has a new job: United Nations special envoy for cities and climate change."," Michael R. Bloomberg, the billionaire former mayor of New York City, has a new job: United Nations special envoy for cities and climate change. The United Nations secretary general’s office said Friday that Mr. Bloomberg would be responsible for nudging cities around the world to take steps to combat climate change, helping to “raise political will and mobilize action among cities” in the months before a climate summit meeting that is scheduled to take place in New York in September. The United Nations climate agenda has been entangled in arguments between rich and poor nations over who should more urgently take steps to reduce carbon emissions. As mayor, Mr. Bloomberg set a citywide goal to slash emissions by 30 percent by 2030. He tried to penalize taxi owners who did not use fuel-efficient hybrid cars, but the courts blocked that effort in 2011, calling it a de facto regulation of emissions standards — a power that, under existing laws, belongs to the federal government. Reuters first reported the news of Mr. Bloomberg’s appointment early on Friday. “I can’t think of a person better suited for this important new role,” Secretary of State John Kerry said in a statement.

Beyoncé Knowles provides the voice for the Leafmen’s ruler, whose 100-year reign will end when a flower pod bursts under a full moon to reveal the new queen; Christoph Waltz is the leader of the Boggans, who cruise on flying rodents; and Steven Tyler is the distracted yellow caterpillar in charge of recording the forest’s history. “The gorgeous 3-D adventure comedy,” Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times, “suggests a warmer, fuzzier ‘Avatar,’ with a green heart. Directed by Chris Wedge, the movie is a hymn to nature rendered in phantasmagoric detail as refined as anything I’ve seen in a computer-animated family film. But as beautiful as it is, ‘Epic’ is fatally lacking in visceral momentum and dramatic edge.” Still, he added, “for what it’s worth, ‘Epic’ is on the side of the angels.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/01/arts/television/whats-on-saturday.html

It recently opened its 2014 season with a cartoon graphic of a beautiful, multicolored, flower-filled garden with a butterfly fluttering across the screen. Then, suddenly, a concrete wall rises up all around the garden, which was an image the producers used last year. But this season not only does the wall emerge but a glass dome rises out of the wall and seals off this Garden of Eden from above as well.

This is a case that has been written about endlessly, but this is the first time that Dylan Farrow herself has written about it in public. It’s important to note that Woody Allen was never prosecuted in this case and has consistently denied wrongdoing; he deserves the presumption of innocence. So why publish an account of an old case on my blog? Partly because the Golden Globe lifetime achievement award to Allen ignited a debate about the propriety of the award. Partly because the root issue here isn’t celebrity but sex abuse. And partly because countless people on all sides have written passionately about these events, but we haven’t fully heard from the young woman who was at the heart of them. I’ve written a column about this, but it’s time for the world to hear Dylan’s story in her own words.)",Opinion,https://kristof.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/02/01/an-open-letter-from-dylan-farrow/

Our hope was to bring a new twist to celebrity portraiture and produce some unusual images. One of the actors cast for the “Dream House” portfolio was Philip Seymour Hoffman. He agreed to go up to Rutland on a Sunday in August. I remember thinking, as we were driving to meet up with him at our rendezvous in a shopping center parking lot, How will we know which car he is in? But there in the big empty lot, in one lone car smack in the middle of it, was a man reading The New York Times. Philip Seymour Hoffman knew how to make an entrance.

The country’s constitutional monarchy has faced coups and street protests in the past, but it has been a model of relative stability and development in Southeast Asia, a region known for its autocratic and brutal governments. As an American treaty ally, Thailand has been critically important in helping to reduce regional tensions and provided balance to the growing military assertiveness of China by championing trade and economic integration partly through the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. On Sunday, protesters disrupted the vote by blocking the distribution of ballot boxes to polling places in about 11 percent of the country’s electoral districts. Because Thailand’s Constitution requires that 95 percent of parliamentary seats be filled before a new government can be formed, the disruption means the country will remain in limbo for months as election authorities try to conduct elections in those districts where protesters prevented a vote from taking place. A gun battle between protesters and government supporters left seven people injured on Saturday, a day before the elections.",Opinion,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/04/opinion/democracy-in-thailand-interrupted.html

2014-02-04,What’s On Tuesday,Television highlights.,"10 P.M. (Starz Cinema) RUST AND BONE (2012) Ali (Matthias Schoenaerts), a former prizefighter fleeing with his young son (Armand Verdure) from a bad situation, arrives in Antibes, on the Côte d’Azur. At a club where he works as a bouncer, he meets Stephanie (Marion Cotillard, above, with Mr. Schoenaerts), a trainer for a Sea World-like amusement park. Then she loses her legs in an accident with a killer whale and calls him, thinking he might help rouse her from her despair. “A plot summary of ‘Rust and Bone’ might suggest a maudlin, therapeutic fable of healing, and in many ways — or, let’s say, in hindsight — the movie is just that,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. “But its conventional, sentimental essence (which is overtly revealed only at the end) is effectively complicated, indeed almost undone, by the jagged textures of the filmmaking and the naturalistic intensity of the performances.” He added: “The removal of Ms. Cotillard’s legs — including in scenes in which she wears a bathing suit or nothing — is surely one of the most impressive special-effects feats of the year, and a reminder that digital cinema is not all about accessorizing wizards, monsters and superheroes. But the greater marvel is Ms. Cotillard herself, an actress of limitless bravery and supernatural poise, who is both beauty and beast. Mr. Schoenaerts is her perfect foil and complement, as large and coarse as she is small and delicate, and also as tender as she is tough.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/04/arts/television/whats-on-tuesday.html

Seeger was inspired artistically throughout his lifetime by the force of the mighty, meandering river, and it was Seeger that the British graphic designer Nick Hand initially had in mind when he decided, in the spring of 2012, to log about 550 miles biking through the region to interview and photograph members of its artisan community.

They quote a member of Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates’s inner circle, who somewhat patronizingly describes it as traversing the “stages of Hillary”: “You know, you first dread the prospect of working with her, then you sort of begrudgingly begin to respect her, then you outright respect her and her incredible work ethic. You know, she’s inexhaustible, she’s tough-minded, and then you come to actually start to like her, and you just can’t believe it, but you actually like this person, and she’s charming and she’s funny and she’s interesting and she’s inquisitive and she’s engaging.” ",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/07/books/h-r-c-portrays-its-subject-as-loyal-and-ready-for-action.html

It was Peck who led the team of World War II Allied saboteurs in “The Guns of Navarone,” one of those men-on-a-mission movies, a subgenre that includes everything from “The Dirty Dozen” to the “Ocean’s Eleven” trilogy, which starred Mr. Clooney in a fizzier, less sanctimonious mode.

Filmed mostly in the 1970s in some of the places where the killing was planned and carried out, “Shoah,” released in 1985, relies on face-to-face, after-the-fact testimony rather than archival footage or dramatic reconstruction. It is thus simultaneously about the imperative to remember and the inadequacy of memory. A masterpiece of historical detective work, the film is also a philosophical exploration of a gap that has only grown wider in the years since its release.

2014-02-07,What’s On Friday,Television highlights.,"9 P.M. (Starz) BEFORE MIDNIGHT (2013) Nine years after rekindling a romance (“Before Sunset”) in Paris that began nine years before that (“Before Sunrise”) in Vienna, Celine (Julie Delpy) and Jesse (Ethan Hawke, above, with Ms. Delpy) are now in Greece, at the end of a summer vacation with their twin daughters (Jennifer and Charlotte Prior) and the son (Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick) he left behind in Chicago. Jesse wonders if they could move from Paris to the United States to spend more time with his son. Celine sees his question as a demand to make it happen. And so they will fight about this — and the meaning of love, the nature of time and the difference between men and women — throughout the course of a day. “ ‘Before Sunrise,’ ‘Before Sunset’ and ‘Before Midnight’ are modest, charming movies that together add up to the great romantic epic of a generation defined, in the popular mind and our therapists’ offices, by hedged bets, easy ironies and perpetual confusion,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times of this trilogy from the director Richard Linklater. Celine and Jesse “can get on your nerves almost as much as they get on each other’s,” Mr. Scott added. “We have known them, and they have known each other, for a long time now, but we don’t know, from one moment to the next, what their future will be, or what it is that keeps them going. That kind of uncertainty, a scary fact of life, is something most movies avoid. We prefer the magical thinking of neat endings, tidy plots and clear character arcs. ‘Before Midnight’ is a wonderful paradox: a movie passionately committed to the ideal of imperfection that is itself very close to perfect.” ",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/07/arts/television/whats-on-friday.html

When the light is gradually diminished bringing on the darkness of night in the dome, and the stars are ‘turned on,’ the audience gasps audibly in surprise at the breathtaking beauty of it.”",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/09/magazine/who-made-that-planetarium.html

In 1988, in his review of Gabriel García Márquez’s “Love in the Time of Cholera,” Thomas Pynchon judged that García Márquez wrote “with impassioned control, out of a maniacal serenity.” Calling the book “shining and heartbreaking,” he added it to the ranks of novels that can “return our worn souls to us.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/09/books/review/in-the-eye-of-the-beholder.html

The Virgin Queen took it with her when she moved from one royal residence to the next, chased by winter drafts and the inevitable buildup of noisome effluvia emanating from the rudimentary sanitation of her privy. As Anna Whitelock’s “The Queen’s Bed” proves, there is still a new and fascinating vantage from which to consider Elizabeth I. While most historians of the period dissect the body politic, Whitelock doesn’t waste time in the halls of Parliament. Instead, she hastens straight to the boudoir of the queen who chose celibacy as a means of wielding power.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/09/books/review/the-queens-bed-by-anna-whitelock.html

The picture was created several years after the Nixons’ abrupt departure from Washington, and only for the sake of the subject’s daughters. The painted Mrs. Nixon seems stricken, ready to brim with tears.

For fall, the answer is: loads of graphic eyeliner. “I was inspired by yé-yé girls from the ’60s, like Françoise Hardy,” the makeup artist Gucci Westman said of the “tomboy-ish” look she created backstage this afternoon. Her muse is “accessible and cool,” Westman continued, but has a “contemporary edge and toughness.” In the makeup chair, that translated into a modern cat-eye with a strong, geometric shape. The eyeliner “goes straight out, and doesn’t follow the lash line, which makes it slightly different,” Westman explained of her technique, which involved topping Revlon ColorStay Crème Gel Liner with Revlon ColorStay Liquid Eye Pen. To clean up the edges, Westman relied on an angled Q-Tip when necessary; she left the rest of the face relatively bare. “The eyeliner is meant to be your one trick,” she said. “This is not a high-maintenance girl.” Indeed, the British model Georgia May Jagger paid Westman the ultimate compliment by describing the finished look as “quite normal — it’s actually something I would wear out.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/02/07/backstage-beauty-report-liner-notes-at-rag-bone/

2014-02-08,What’s On Saturday,Television highlights.,"8 P.M. (HBO) 42 (2013) Chadwick Boseman, above, portrays Jackie Robinson, a shortstop for the Kansas City Monarchs of the Negro leagues, a four-sport athlete at U.C.L.A. and an Army officer during World War II. Harrison Ford plays Branch Rickey, the president and general manager of the Brooklyn Dodgers who selected Robinson to become the first black major leaguer of the modern era. But when Rickey calls his new player “superhuman,” what he means is that Robinson will have to rise above ordinary temptations in the face of prejudice and hostility to become a flawless exemplar of his race. “While ‘42,’ Brian Helgeland’s new film about Robinson, gestures toward the complicated and painful history in which its subject was embroiled,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York York Times, “it is blunt, simple and sentimental, using time-tested methods to teach a clear and rousing lesson.” He continued, “In other hands — Spike Lee’s, let’s say, or even Clint Eastwood’s — ‘42’ might have taken a tougher, more contentious look at the breaking of Major League Baseball’s color barrier.” But Mr. Helgeland “has honorably sacrificed the chance to make a great movie in the interest of making one that is accessible and inspiring. Though not accurate in every particular, the movie mostly succeeds in respecting the facts of history and the personality of its hero, and in reminding audiences why he mattered.” ",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/08/arts/television/whats-on-saturday.html

2014-02-09,Document | Made for More Than Walking,A single photograph of a woman’s legs may be titillating.

But a cluster of 30 glamorous gams cut from the pages of glossy magazines is more than that. “Legs,” by the German artist Hans-Peter Feldmann, questions, with an erotomaniac’s attention to detail, advertising’s ravenous commodification of beauty. The 73-year-old’s work, an obsessive appropriation of everyday objects — from photographs of unmade beds to the front pages of 250 newspapers dated Sept. 12, 2001 — is in line with that of American conceptualists like Richard Prince and Dash Snow. And yet, he has trouble explaining his ideas: “When they asked the Austrian composer Bruckner what inspired his masterwork ‘Te Deum,’ he said it came to him while . . . eating a cheese sandwich.” Feldmann frankly loves sitting in a cafe and admiring the pretty passers-by, but says that the best legs he knows belong to Ursula, his wife of more than 40 years. “Is it sexist of me to focus so much on a woman’s legs?” he wonders. “I don’t know.

2014-02-09,Backstage Beauty Report | Parting Ways at Alexander Wang,The masculine hair at last night’s show was inspired by one of the designer’s own fashion sketches.,"“I wanted to do hair that was very drawn on, like an illustration,” the hairstylist Guido Palau said of the superslick and tight-to-the-head looks he created backstage at Alexander Wang last night. Fittingly, the inspiration turned out to be a fashion sketch the designer penned himself in advance of the show. To bring it all to life, Palau etched a deep side part with his comb and saturated strands in Redken Control Addict 28 High-Control Hairspray before wrapping them firmly around the head. “It’s like a very low sweep-over, like a man’s hair,” he remarked (otherwise known as the comb-over; who knew it could look so cool?). Palau then patted on a Redken Shine Flash 02 Glistening Mist for some sheen, and pulled strands into a slim ponytail, which was later tucked out of sight into the models’ clothing. To reinforce this idea of hair-as-fashion-illustration, he also “painted away” the part lines with makeup to prevent any skin from showing, and gave the models who closed the show — including Karlie Kloss, Jacquetta Wheeler and Joan Smalls — a blast of colored hair powder for an ultra-matte effect, like ink set to dry on paper.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/02/09/backstage-beauty-report-parting-ways-at-alexander-wang/

But in big theaters, it’s easy to take much for granted — whereas studio conditions bring us closer to the practical physics of ballet. On Saturday night, when the young dancers of American Ballet Theater’s Studio Company performed at the 92nd Street Y Buttenwieser Hall, their courage was evident — and admirable — in the opening ensemble adagio of the first item.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/10/arts/dance/american-ballet-theaters-studio-company-displays-growth.html

2014-02-09,"‘Get Lucky,’ Sochi Style","A group of police officers became sudden celebrities by covering “Get Lucky,” Daft Punk’s Grammy Award-winning record of the year, shortly before the opening ceremony of the Olympics.","The Olympics usually mint new and unlikely stars. Nearly always, they are athletes. But on Friday night, a group of mostly stern-looking police officers became sudden celebrities by covering “Get Lucky,” Daft Punk’s Grammy Award-winning record of the year shortly before the opening ceremony of the Winter Games from Sochi, Russia. The performance by the Ministry of Internal Affairs choir of “Get Lucky” went viral: It has been seen about 750,000 times since NBC posted it online. The choir’s reward: an appearance on Monday morning on NBC’s “Today.” The incongruity of the choir, dressed in evergreen uniforms accented by yellow braided cords, performing the slightly racy song (“She’s up all night for good fun/I’m up all night to get lucky”), doubtlessly accounts for its appeal. The two lead singers were the stars (a baritone joined them later); some others bobbed their heads but did not get funky, while others looked uncomfortable at their surreal dip into dance music. Rolling Stone labeled the police choir’s rendition “incredible” and noted “the officers’ hilarious ‘old, goofy man dancing at a wedding reception’ dance moves.” A spokeswoman for Daft Punk had no comment on the choir’s cover. The performance followed a studio version of the same number that was posted on YouTube in November. That performance, even more animated than Friday’s, has been viewed nearly 4.4 million times.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/10/arts/music/get-lucky-sochi-style.html

2014-02-10,Backstage Beauty Report | Ballet Rehearsal Buns at Diane von Furstenberg,"Russian ballerinas inspired the designer’s collection, which was topped off with slightly messy yet prim updos.","With show venues spread far and wide this season, there’s a certain athleticism involved in leaping around the city. On Diane von Furstenberg’s runway in Tribeca yesterday, the relative endurance of the day fit in well with the designer’s theme. “The collection was inspired by Russian ballerinas,” the hairstylist Orlando Pita said backstage. So naturally hair was whisked up into a bun. But Pita noted an important distinction: “Diane wanted the models to look like they were in rehearsal, rather than in performance.” Conveying that sense of unfinished, dashed-off elegance came down to misting BioSilk Dry Clean Shampoo on fine hair for body or rubbing BioSilk Silk Gel Medium Hold on thicker strands for control, and piling everything up into a high ponytail. The length of the tail was then twisted and wrapped around the base, and slightly spread out with the fingers to create a wide, round shape secured with a cupful of bobby pins. But just when the bun began to look too stage-ready, Pita pulled this last step: “The trick is to put finishing spray on your brush and comb back the hair vertically,” he said, demonstrating the technique around the crown. “This makes it look like someone has taken her fingers and combed her hair up.” It lent a subtle rawness, which did seem quite en pointe.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/02/10/backstage-beauty-report-ballet-rehearsal-buns-at-diane-von-furstenberg/

2014-02-11,Backstage Beauty Report | Sporty 3-D Hair at 3.1 Phillip Lim,Hairstylist Paul Hanlon pumped up the volume (and the staying power) with layers upon layers of styling products.,"Hairstyles captured in fashion photography look amazing — but those coifs need only hold up for a few shutter clicks. Backstage at 3.1 Phillip Lim this afternoon, hair pro Paul Hanlon whipped models’ manes into tousled, sporty-slick styles reminiscent of Bruce Weber’s “O Rio de Janeiro” book from the ’80s, but with a durability that would allow the ‘dos to withstand the rigors of the runway (and several hours’ worth of afterparties). “When you see those pictures, somebody’s gone in and done the hair, and it’s a moment. This is 3-D, the models are walking and moving, and you don’t want anything to fall out,” Hanlon explained. Perhaps that was his full-disclosure reason for applying what he admitted was an “excessive” amount of styling fixers: He first brushed through volumizing mousse for body, then massaged on a root booster to help form a pompadourish flip. Next he saturated strands, section by section, in Moroccanoil Treatment Light to create a wet, separated texture all over, and combed Moroccanoil Intense Curl Cream through on the front before pulling the hair tight on the sides and high on the top. To finish, Hanlon doused it all with hair spray. The maximalist approach went over well, creating a modern vibe that model Maggie Jablonski described as “punk, but artistic and beachy.” The only drawback: how to wash out all that product? Just follow Jablonski’s directive: “Stand and watch it melt away in the shower.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/02/10/backstage-beauty-report-sporty-3-d-hair-at-3-1-phillip-lim/

Backstage, the makeup artist James Kaliardos described the inspiration as the time when “you sort of romanticize things like movies and fairytales that stick with you, and affect the way you see beauty.” The Rodarte princess, however, is all grown up and has a dark side to her as well. Providing that much-needed edge: a pair of iridescent lip colors done in rich shades of mauve and lavender. “Kate and Laura are so into makeup, and the subtle differences in color,” Kaliardos said about the Mulleavy sisters, noting that they spent hours deciding on the final palette. The models’ skin tones largely dictated which of the two shades they would wear, but the application technique was the same: Kaliardos lined the mouth with either Nars Velvet Lip Liner Pencil in El Agua (a deep rose, to be released in the fall) or Nars Eyeliner in Mambo, a reddish brown, and then filled in the lips with a corresponding hue (Nars Lipstick in Dominique Audacious and Deborah Audacious, respectively; both available in the fall). Lastly, he topped everything off with a custom blend of glitter — rose and gold mixed into a base of lipstick and gloss — packed on the mouth with a small makeup brush for precision.

Audrey’s ordinary teenage conundrums — how to make friends at a new school; how to act around a boy she likes — are amplified by the demands of presidential protocol and security: she can’t even choose her own clothes.

2014-02-13,What’s on Thursday,Television highlights.,"2 P.M. (Starz Cinema) THE DIVING BELL AND THE BUTTERFLY (2007) Jean-Dominique Bauby, a 43-year-old French magazine editor and something of a playboy, had a stroke in 1995 that left him with a condition in which he retained vision, hearing and a functioning mind but was almost completely paralyzed. He told his story in a book that he dictated to an assistant by blinking. In this film from the artist Julian Schnabel, Bauby is played by Mathieu Amalric; Emmanuelle Seigner is Céline, the longtime partner he has recently left and the mother of his three children; and Marie-Josée Croze is the speech therapist who teaches him to use his left eyelid to communicate. “The phrase ‘triumph of the human spirit’ hovers over ‘The Diving Bell and the Butterfly,’ along with a swarm of other empty, uplifting clichés,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. “But Mr. Schnabel and the screenwriter, Ronald Harwood, have other themes in mind” — among them, limitation, constraint and incarceration — Mr. Scott said. (Both men were nominated for Oscars.) “Their common subject, however, is freedom, the self-willed liberation of a difficult, defiant individual,” Mr. Scott wrote, adding that Mr. Schnabel demonstrated this with “imaginative freedom in every frame and sequence, dispensing with narrative and expository conventions in favor of a wild, intuitive honesty.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/13/arts/television/whats-on-thursday.html

These days, at a smaller venue on the Lower East Side called Old Man Hustle, the pool of audience members and participants might be 30 (though many now know one another). Miller, who considers her open-mike nights “the last vestiges of bohemianism in downtown New York,” attributes the decline to gentrification and the Internet, where people can more easily get their fix of performance art by up-and-comers. “There isn’t the incentive that we had in the ’90s to get out the door and actually do something.” But for Daniel Gallant, director of the Nuyorican Poets Cafe, which introduced open mikes in 1973, social media has been a boon: “The performances generate more viral activity online,” he says.

2014-02-14,Inside the List,"Robin Cook’s “Cell,” No. 11 on the hardcover fiction list, may be the first thriller to open with an entire paragraph about insulin molecules.","The Doctor Will Thrill You Now: Like a lot of brand-name novelists, Robin Cook drops a new book every year or two — in Cook’s case, medical thrillers with punchy, ominous titles like “Outbreak,” “Terminal” or “Contagion” that invariably land on the list. His latest, “Cell” (new at No. 11), is his 28th hardcover best seller since “Coma” made his reputation in 1977. Cook started his career as a practicing doctor, but eventually devoted himself more and more to writing, where the malpractice premiums are presumably lower. From the start, he has applied himself studiously to his craft. “It’s easier to get a book published if it’s going to be a best seller,” he told an interviewer in 1977, “so I went back to some old New York Times best-seller lists and tried to find books that came from theretofore unknown writers, to try to determine what kind of book had the best chances of making the list. I found the mystery-thriller genre seemed to do this best.” If that approach seems more robotic than inspired, well, so can Cook’s prose — “Cell” may be the first thriller to open with an entire paragraph about insulin molecules. (“Rapidly infiltrating the veins, they rushed headlong into the heart, to be pumped out through the arteries.”) Then again, Cook doesn’t make great claims for himself as a writer. “I’m a storyteller,” he told the CBS reporter Don Dahler earlier this month. “I have never been tempted to wear a turtleneck — big turtleneck, white turtleneck.

2014-02-14,Women of a Certain Era,Two books examine the lives of outrageous female celebrities of the 1920s.,"“I find life quite impossible,” wrote Nancy Cunard, the English heiress famous in the 1920s for her fashionable excess, “as I cannot enjoy a thing without carrying it to all the extremes and then nearly dying of the reaction.” She wasn’t the only one blowing past her limits during that risky era, but as Judith Mackrell puts it in “Flappers: Six Women of a Dangerous Generation,” she was an audacious female forerunner preceding a “collective surge in expectation.” Women on the verge demanded more from life than marriage and motherhood. Joining Cunard in her restless experimentation were the outrageous actress Tallulah Bankhead, the brazen aristocrat Diana Cooper, the electrifying jazz dancerJosephine Baker, the Polish-Russian painter Tamara de Lempicka and America’s über-flapper, Zelda Fitzgerald. They shared an edgy ambition and a taste for immoderation that led them crashing through the public psyche, sometimes brilliantly, sometimes not, but always on toward emancipation — or at least on to the next great party. As Mackrell demonstrates so elegantly, their collective defiance redefined the feminine possible.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/16/books/review/flappers-and-careless-people.html

In “A Dreadful Deceit,” the distinguished historian Jacqueline Jones vehemently rejects this redemptive and self-congratulatory narrative.

Additional highlights include a behind-the-scenes look at Matthew Barney’s epic new art film; a pair of New York icons, Elaine Stritch and Chloë Sevigny, tune in to the latest rap music; and five prominent novelists — Colson Whitehead, Douglas Coupland, Mona Simpson, Joyce Carol Oates and Roddy Doyle — invite us into the spaces where they created their latest works.

Certifying itself as a full-blown phenomenon, “The Lego Movie” (Warner Brothers) will take in a projected $60 million between Friday and Monday, for a two-week domestic total of roughly $140 million. “About Last Night” (Sony), one of three 1980s-era remakes to arrive over the weekend, was expected to be the No. 1 newcomer by selling a strong $30.2 million in tickets. Co-starring the popular comedian Kevin Hart, “About Last Night” cost $13 million to make. Third-place “RoboCop” from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Sony was a disappointment considering that it had a production budget of at least $100 million; if analyst projections hold, the science-fiction remake will take in $25.1 million over the long weekend, for a total since opening on Wednesday of about $30 million. (A Sony spokeswoman noted that “RoboCop” is performing “very strongly” overseas, where it has taken in more than $70 million since opening earlier this month.) “The Monuments Men,” also from Sony, was expected to be a solid fourth, generating a projected $17.3 million, for a two-week total of about $46 million. Analysts estimated that Universal’s poorly reviewed remake of “Endless Love” would take in about $15.2 million, which is fine for a lightly marketed movie that cost about $20 million to make. But Akiva Goldsman’s “Winter’s Tale” (Warner) bombed badly, taking in a projected $8.5 million. Adapted from the 1983 magical realism novel, “Winter’s Tale” cost Warner and financing partner Village Roadshow at least $45 million to make.",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/02/16/lego-movie-tops-box-office-with-about-last-night-strong-second/

The party patriarch Deng Xiaoping deemed the demonstrations, based in Tiananmen Square in Beijing, a grave threat to party power. He authorized martial law in urban Beijing, ousted Mr. Hu’s successor as party general secretary, the reform-minded Zhao Ziyang, and ordered the People’s Liberation Army to end the demonstrations. The crackdown culminated in troops taking Tiananmen Square in the early hours of June 4. Across Beijing, many hundreds of protesters and ordinary citizens caught in the wrong place died from military gunfire, and soldiers also died at the hands of incensed residents.

Thus it was a big deal in January 2013 when Alastair Macaulay declared in The New York Times that Justin Peck was “the third important choreographer to have emerged in classical ballet this century.” ",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/23/arts/dance/justin-peck-rising-ballet-choreographer.html

Burroughs’s “Naked Lunch.” The book had appeared three years earlier in more lenient Paris; Charles Poore wrote that it arrived in the United States “already somewhat barnacled with notoriety and no doubt considered demi-passe in demi-avant-garde quadrangles.” Poore sniffed at the news that participants at an Edinburgh festival “pronounced it a work of considerable influence. This we can easily believe, in view of the more esoteric tendencies of current writing.

2014-02-21,The Rage in Harlem,The many lives of the early-20th-century cultural impresario Carl Van Vechten.,"One of the milestones of modernism occurred in Paris on May 29, 1913, when “The Rite of Spring” debuted at the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées and almost caused a riot. Startled by Stravinsky’s pounding rhythms and Nijinsky’s salacious choreography, the well-heeled philistines in the audience roared with disapproval while the connoisseurs, the happy few, tried shouting them down. One of the most memorable accounts of that first night was written by the American critic Carl Van Vechten, who allied himself decidedly with the latter camp, reporting that a kindred soul in the seat behind him was so carried away that he began beating a tattoo on the critic’s head with his fists. “My emotion was so great,” Van Vechten wrote, “that I did not feel the blows for some time.” Sharing his box was another pillar of the avant-garde, Gertrude Stein, who remembered certain details differently — as well she should, Van Vechten assured her. They had actually attended the less eventful second night of the ballet, but, as he suavely added, “one must only be accurate about such details in a work of fiction.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/23/books/review/the-tastemaker-by-edward-white.html

He was a real artist; he had a vision.” Cantor’s vision often fo­cuses on public figures: George Herriman’s cartoon cat and J. Robert Oppenheimer; Che Guevara in Cantor’s first novel, “The Death of Che Guevara”; and now Kafka in “Forgiving the Angel.” These works and his graphic novel, “Aaron and Ahmed,” are contraptions of mixed materials: animal and human characters in “Krazy Kat,” fact and invention in “Che Guevara,” lucid writing and hallucinatory illustrations (by James Romberger) in “Aaron and Ahmed,” and now a story putatively by Kafka and stories about contemporaries who loved him. All of Cantor’s fiction (including “Great Neck,” his un-­gadgety novel of the American 1960s and ’70s) pulls the reader’s mind through sensitive history: atom bomb tests at Alamogordo; the Cuban revolution; the events of 9/11; and, in “Forgiving the Angel,” Stalin’s gulag and Hitler’s death camps.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/23/books/review/forgiving-the-angel-by-jay-cantor.html

St. Vincent. From a distance, it looked a bit like a toothbrush or perhaps one of those hand-held, skin-firming wands. Nope! Turns out, it was one of three new Masterclass Makeup Brushes from M.A.C. Launched this winter, these newfangled tools perform all the usual beauty tasks — blending eye shadow, smudging eyeliner, buffing foundation into the skin, saturating the lips with color — albeit with a supercool design unlike that of a traditional brush. The most noticeable difference: The head and handle point toward the face, rather than away from it, which allows you to actually see what you’re doing in the mirror without hands getting in the way (imagine that!). Another plus: The densely packed synthetic bristles — or, rather, “cosmefibres” — evenly disperse makeup particles over the face, sans streaks. Oh, and the rubberized handles are just comfy to hold, which is key for a busy makeup artist like Regan Rabanal, who spent hours painting faces at numerous New York Fashion Week shows, including Zac Posen, Cushnie Et Ochs and Badgley Mischka.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/22/t-magazine/on-beauty-new-beauty-tools-mac.html

Huge data breaches at big retailers like Target have made it seem unsafe to use credit cards.

To the left of the divide, tousled locks were tucked behind the ear and draped naturally over the shoulder. And on the right, they were pushed forward over the ear for what Philippon described as a “rock ‘n’ roll twist.” “I loaded the hair with Bb.Gel from Bumble and Bumble,” he explained while combing the product through and then ruffling it with his fingers. To finish, he used Bumble and Bumble’s new City Swept spray, which provided “beautiful natural shine.” The texture of this look is in fact quite stiff, but it offers the illusion of soft, wet hair. “I would have left it wet,” Philippon noted, “but we had fur.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/02/25/backstage-beauty-report-cedric-charliers-side-swept-locks/

2014-02-26,Covering All Corners of the Earth,Google Earth images are the foundation for a series of locally made carpets.,"Weaving together geology, anthropology and Google Earth imagery, the Dutch designer Roosmarijn Pallandt has developed a series of carpets called Consider This Landscape a Territory. She begins with a bird’s-eye photograph of a rug-making region like northern Portugal, Nepal or Japan, then spends months researching each culture and its traditional rug-making techniques. Finally, she converts the original aerial image into a carpet produced by local artisans from natural materials. For the Flora rug, for example, which will be exhibited at the International Furniture Fair in Milan in April, a half-dozen women in Portugal hand-knotted felted wool yarn, jute and eucalyptus. The Ice carpet was knotted by a Tibetan family using wool from sheep, yak and goats combined with silk. The rugs can be ordered through Ms. Pallandt’s studio, in collaboration with Casalis, a Belgian carpet company. Prices start at about $1,168 per square meter.

The trend continued at Marc Jacobs, whose neutral collection was filled with plush, nubby matching separates like a ribbed, V-neck long sweater with coordinating leggings and scarf.

At 14, he saw a photograph of a passenger pigeon in an Audubon Society book and “fell in love.” But he didn’t know that the Science Museum of Minnesota, which he was then visiting with a summer program for North Dakotan high-school students, had them in their collection, so he was shocked when he came across a cabinet containing two stuffed pigeons, a male and a female, mounted in lifelike poses. He was overcome by awe, sadness and the birds’ physical beauty: their bright auburn breasts, slate-gray backs and the dusting of iridescence around their napes that, depending on the light and angle, appeared purple, fuchsia or green. Before his chaperones dragged him out of the room, Novak snapped a photograph with his disposable camera. The flash was too strong, however, and when the film was processed several weeks later, he was haunted to discover that the photograph hadn’t developed. It was blank, just a flash of white light.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/02/magazine/the-mammoth-cometh.html

If there is, the Shanghai artist Xu Zhen, often called the Maurizio Cattelan of China, fits the bill. Combining the roles of artist, curator and chief executive of his own corporation, MadeIn, he has forged a career of pushing buttons, consistently riling audiences with shocking installations though rarely provoking the Chinese government. He is considered the leader of a younger generation of Chinese artists who have disengaged from the Mao-driven paintings of the 1990s in favor of more conceptual projects.

But instead of using makeup to create the illusion of a flawless face, he pampered the models with face massages to help the blood circulate and to suss out an all-natural glow. Pecheux then nourished the skin with Rodin Olio Lusso face oil, for both hydration and luminosity, followed by Estée Lauder’s Revitalizing Supreme and Idealist Pore-Minimizing Skin Refinisher. After this deluxe treatment, Pecheux applied foundation — he advises mixing two hues, especially during transitional seasons — and powder. Eyebrows were teased out to be fuller, “but not bushy, not extravagant, not Frida Kahlo,” he explained, adding that “eyebrows give a woman character.” Overall, it was a spare, natural look. “If your skin looks beautiful, you already look beautiful. After that, everything else is accessory,” Pecheux reasoned. “At Balmain, there is a lot of accessorizing on the body, so you don’t need accessorizing on the face.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/02/27/backstage-beauty-report-truly-glowing-skin-at-balmain/

But as the art critic Jerry Saltz wrote in New York magazine last fall, maybe we’re finally at a point where the strangeness of the times is matched by an ability to accept it. In defending the perplexing Kanye West video “Bound 2,” Saltz heralded this as an age of the New Uncanny. The all-American banal-bizarre spectacle of the video (synthetic sunsets; slow-motion galloping stallions; the nippleless ingénue) is “a freakish act of creation and destruction by appropriation,” what Saltz deems “part of a collective cultural fracturing.” Saltz is riffing on Freud’s description of the uncanny as “nothing new or alien, but something familiar and old-established in the mind and which has become alienated from it only through the process of repression.” But maybe we’re not as alienated as we once were, something that occurred to me when beholding another unapologetic, all-encompassing contradiction-celebration: the story-allegory and real-surreal gyre of Helen Oyeyemi’s gloriously unsettling new novel, “Boy, Snow, Bird.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/02/books/review/boy-snow-bird-by-helen-oyeyemi.html

Hayter just needed to find the perfect young werewolf, and he settled on a relatively unknown actor named Lucas Till as the lead. “I thought of Lucas because I felt this movie was about a kid on the verge of adulthood,” said Hayter, who also wrote the screenplays for “Watchmen” and “X-Men.” “And this is the story that takes him over the brink.”",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/02/magazine/the-last-disposable-action-hero.html

(Some kite strings have been dipped in an emulsion that includes finely ground glass.) When a participant successfully downs another kite, a small trumpet sounds a victory blast. The festival, which is celebrated at the end of the mild Indian winter, when daytime temperatures hover in the 80s, is tied to a traditional day on the Hindu calendar that marks the change of seasons. “Flying a kite brings good luck and good fortune in the new year,” says Tobias Hutzler, who captured images of the festival. “They are sending wishes into the air.” Julie Bosman",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/02/magazine/battle-of-the-kites.html

By the 19th century, potential wives were paying a bond of £200 for the privilege of sailing off to a strange land to ally themselves with a virtual stranger. And pity the poor soul who — despite a ratio of three or four men to every woman, inspiring tales of proposals offered at funerals and engagements announced as husbands lay dying — failed to drag the humblest prospect to the altar. Put on a ship back to England, she would now be dismissed as one of the “Returned Empties.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/02/books/review/the-fishing-fleet-by-anne-de-courcy.html

Although named after Diana, Princess of Wales — the “saint for betrayed women” — Ladydi is called “Boy” by her mother, Rita. Turning girls into boys — or at least making them ugly — is a matter of survival on the mountain. Girls get short haircuts at the “ugly parlor”; Ladydi even colors her teeth with black and yellow markers to make them look rotted. “All the drug traffickers had to do was hear that there was a pretty girl around,” she says, “and they’d sweep onto our lands in black Escalades and carry the girl off.” ",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/02/books/review/prayers-for-the-stolen-by-jennifer-clement.html

Feminist themes and generous amounts of Renaissance Faire-style potted history make her storytelling all the more suggestive. Eerie and powerful acts of nature signify undercurrents of mood the way irregular minor chords in the background music tell us how to feel during ominous scenes at the movies. Lost in a dark forest of one kind or another, Hoffman’s characters have a heightened awareness of the hidden meanings that surround them as they struggle toward the light.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/02/books/review/alice-hoffmans-museum-of-extraordinary-things.html

2014-02-28,"Strong, Silent Types",These stories center on a gritty corner of British Columbia.,"Short-story collections might be divided into two groups. One is the hodgepodge, the mixtape, the gathering together of stray parts from here and there. D. W. Wilson’s “Once You Break a Knuckle” keeps a rarer company — the collection in which the stories are in conversation, and together form a world to be explored not linearly but sideways, more than once, through previously unexplored corridors and secret passageways hiding in plain sight. These books, by design, are echo chambers of empathy. The world is large, they seem to say, and it is full of other people whose lives are as important to themselves as mine is to me and yours is to you.

2014-02-28,Just Say Nein,"A memoir of the author’s father, a Prussian conservative who nonetheless opposed Hitler.","Joachim Fest’s fascinating memoir about what it was like to come of age during the years of the Third Reich is unusual because its central character is not the author but the author’s remarkable father. Johannes Fest was the middle-class headmaster of a primary school in suburban Berlin, a pious Catholic and father of five, a cultural conservative who revered Goethe and Kant, and a loyal German patriot — “a dyed-in-the-wool Prussian,” in Fest’s words — the kind of person who might have been expected to become an active supporter of Adolf Hitler and the National Socialists. In a foreword by Herbert Arnold (a professor emeritus of German studies at Wesleyan University who has also supplied informative notes throughout the text), the elder Fest is described as “tailor-made for a career” with the Nazis. And yet some quirk in his personality made him a fierce Weimar republican, ready to sacrifice himself, even his family, to principles he knew to be right even as everyone around him was yielding to mass hysteria. “Not I,” a best seller in Germany when it appeared in 2006, the year of the author’s death at age 79, is a memorable tale of lonely courage, stoic endurance, self-imposed hardship and a life lived amid ubiquitous, all-­encompassing danger: “Even ­innocent-sounding remarks could be life-and-death matters.” It reminds us that simple human decency is possible even in the most trying of ­circumstances.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/02/books/review/not-i-by-joachim-fest.html

2014-02-28,It Takes a Funeral: So Much Angst,Patrice Chéreau was a creature of the theater. But he had a parallel career as a moviemaker.,"Patrice Chéreau was a creature of the theater. But he had a parallel career as a moviemaker, which the Film Society of Lincoln Center is honoring in the series Patrice Chéreau: The Love That Dares. If nothing he did for the screen had the genre-shaking impact of his stage work — his 1976 “Ring” cycle at Bayreuth helped usher in an era of Regietheater, or director’s theater — he did raise eyebrows with the sexually explicit “Intimacy” (2001), starring all of Mark Rylance, the corseted Olivia in the “Twelfth Night” that just ended its Broadway run. “Intimacy” was much discussed for how much it showed and how real or not the sex was, though what’s most real — and naked — is the emotional life of Mr. Rylance’s character. “Those Who Love Me Can Take the Train” (1998) only seems more buttoned up. As a train hurtles toward Limoges and a funeral, Mr. Chéreau plunges us into a world of interlocking relationships, of sex, desire, despondency. The style is distinctly cinematic, but the emotion verges on operatic. (Through Wednesday; filmlinc.com.) ",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/02/movies/it-takes-a-funeral-so-much-angst.html
