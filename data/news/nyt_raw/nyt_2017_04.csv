This season must begin by acknowledging the surreality that after 108 years, the Chicago Cubs are again World Series champions. “The Plan” (Triumph, $24.95), by David Kaplan, is a chronicle of the project to turn “one of the worst organizations in baseball” into “a dynasty in the making.” Kaplan starts with the 2009 purchase of the franchise by Tom Ricketts, and the subsequent wooing of Theo Epstein, the general manager behind two titles for the formerly cursed Boston Red Sox. Chicago’s farm system is stocked and Joe Maddon, the Tampa Bay Rays manager, is signed ahead of the 2015 season. Add youngsters like Kris Bryant and Kyle Schwarber, and free agents like Jon Lester, and a long-losing club is finally No. 1. There’s too much front-office esoterica — one appendix lists clauses from rooftop-seating contracts for buildings around Wrigley Field — but Cubs fans won’t mind.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/02/books/now-batting-14-new-baseball-books.html

The “degenerate art” was presented in chaos and disarray, accompanied by derogatory labels, graffiti and catalog entries describing “the sick brains of those who wielded the brush or pencil.” Hitler and those close to him strictly controlled how artists lived and worked in Nazi Germany, because they understood that art could play a key role in the rise or fall of their dictatorship and the realization of their vision for Germany’s future.",Opinion,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/06/opinion/why-authoritarians-attack-the-arts.html

For reasons they don’t understand, each’s consciousness has been temporarily jumping into the other’s physical shell, only to jump back.

2017-04-07,One Photographer Spent 25 Years Documenting Wealth,Lauren Greenfield‘s “Generation Wealth” documents the lives of the affluent in America.,"Lauren Greenfield (who may be most well known for her 2012 documentary “The Queen of Versailles”) has been documenting American wealth since 1992, when she began taking pictures of students at her old high school in Santa Monica. “Despite the dramatic divisions in the city revealed by the L.A. riots ... rich kids and poor kids had found common ground that their parents had not, and it was a shared love for Versace,” she writes in “Generation Wealth,” her new book. With a golden cover and 650-odd images inside, the volume is a sociological record of the extreme measures taken to acquire and spend money, what Greenfield calls “the influence of affluence.” One shot shows Tupac at the craps table in Vegas, another, a Chinese billionaire’s replica of the White House. Some of the photographs will go on view this weekend in a show of Greenfield’s work at the Annenberg Space for Photography in Los Angeles, and are set to land in New York this fall, around the release of her next documentary. All of this output suggests a longstanding clarity of purpose, but Greenfield says it wasn’t until the financial crisis of 2008 (which she calls “a morality tale”) that she realized the underlying theme uniting her work. “It’s not about Birkin bags or the Kardashians,” she says. “It’s about the culture that gave rise to them.”",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/07/t-magazine/art/lauren-greenfield-photography-generation-wealth.html

The metaphors we use to talk about brains and minds struck Daugman as especially susceptible. The technology that Greeks and Romans developed for pumping water, for instance, underpinned their theories of the four humors and the pneumatic soul. Later, during the Enlightenment, clockwork mechanisms left their imprint on materialist arguments that man was only a sophisticated machine. And as of 1990, it was concepts from computing that explained us to ourselves: “Today’s embrace of the computational metaphor in the cognitive and neural sciences is so widespread and automatic that it begins to appear less like an innovative leap than like a bandwagon phenomenon,” he wrote. “There is a tendency to rephrase every assertion about mind or brains in computational terms.”",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/11/magazine/new-technology-is-built-on-a-stack-is-that-the-best-way-to-understand-everything-else-too.html

Take Bourgeois’s “Echo I,” a sweatshirt turned inside out, stretched vertically from sleeve to sleeve and cast in bronze, next to a drapey Kawakubo knit wool dress with elongated sleeves bundled at the wrists. The works also share a preoccupation with psychology and the passing of time. For Bourgeois, clothes were tokens of the past, a place she often returned to; accompanying the installation will be a recording of Bourgeois, in her 90s, singing songs from her girlhood. Meanwhile, Dennis Freedman, the former Barneys creative director who conceived of the project, talks of the profundity of watching the Comme des Garçons fall 2015 show: “They narrowed the runway so the models had to turn and face each other before going their separate ways,” he says. “One fashion writer quoted Dickens, saying ‘Life is made of ever so many partings welded together.’” — KATE GUADAGNINO",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/11/t-magazine/rei-kawakubo-louise-bourgeois-salon-94-salad-for-president.html

This had happened only once in N.B.A. history, in 1962, and it seemed unlikely to ever happen again. “Averaging a triple-double,” I wrote, “is like having a helicopter that is also a boat that can also write the Great American Novel”; if Westbrook managed to pull it off, it “would be not only historic and impressive but also a little weird, almost disturbing.”",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/13/magazine/the-unreasonable-genius-of-russell-westbrook.html

Fans of Mary Gaitskill’s fiction (“Bad Behavior,” “Veronica,” “The Mare”) will welcome her essay collection “Somebody With a Little Hammer.” And a courageous book by Ron Powers delves into his family’s struggles with schizophrenia in service of a larger goal: “to arm other families with a sense of urgency that perhaps came to us too late.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/13/books/review/11-new-books-we-recommend-this-week.html

2017-04-14,Being a Lake,Selected by Matthew Zapruder.,"The beginning of this poem describes an odd thought experiment: A man wonders why he has never dreamed of being a lake and then proceeds consciously to will the dream into being. The poem is so accurate and sensory that it easy to forget how suffused it is with desire for a feeling of belonging that the man has never actually had. In this way, it is a nature poem, but also an allegory for any idealized experience never to be attained.

Auden published a very long poem that, despite winning a Pulitzer Prize, is now remembered less for its contents than for its title: “The Age of Anxiety.” Something about the idea that an age can be anxious must resonate deep in America’s cultural bones, because the phrase has been used to describe countless moments since, from the vogue for tranquilizers like Miltown and Valium in the ’50s and ’60s to the coronation of today’s young adults as, in The New York Post’s recent estimation, “The Anxious Generation.” At this point, it’s difficult to imagine a slice of time whose resident humans would not agree with the notion that their lives were more hectically modern — more anxiety-inducing, more in need of the occasional benzo — than any before.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/18/magazine/americas-new-anxiety-disorder.html

In the days that followed, the government took action against several others, including a California-based mortgage lender and a Virginia-based pawnbroker.

Not everyone thinks this is a good idea.,"For the past few years, the Harvard professor David Keith has been sketching this vision: Ten Gulfstream jets, outfitted with special engines that allow them to fly safely around the stratosphere at an altitude of 70,000 feet, take off from a runway near the Equator. Their cargo includes thousands of pounds of a chemical compound — liquid sulfur, let’s suppose — that can be sprayed as a gas from the aircraft. It is not a one-time event; the flights take place throughout the year, dispersing a load that amounts to 25,000 tons. If things go right, the gas converts to an aerosol of particles that remain aloft and scatter sunlight for two years. The payoff? A slowing of the earth’s warming — for as long as the Gulfstream flights continue.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/18/magazine/is-it-ok-to-engineer-the-environment-to-fight-climate-change.html

Outside of projects like his 2007 memoir, “Born Standing Up: A Comic’s Life,” getting Mr. Martin, 71, to talk now about his days as “a wild and crazy guy” or movies like “The Jerk” is like asking him to make you one of his bad balloon animals: It ain’t gonna happen.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/18/arts/steve-martin-comedy-dave-chappelle.html

The map imagined the city in the year 2072, after 60 years of rapid sea-level rise totaling 200 feet. At present, San Francisco is a roughly square-shaped, peninsular city. But on the map, it is severed clean from the mainland and shaved into a long, fat smudge. The shape of the land resembles a sea bird diving underwater for prey, with odd bays chewing into the coastlines and, farther out, a sprawl of bulging and wispy islands that used to be hills. If you lived in San Francisco, it was a map of where you already were and, simultaneously, where you worried you might be heading. “The San Francisco Archipelago,” Burrito Justice called it — a formerly coherent city in shards.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/19/magazine/our-climate-future-is-actually-our-climate-present.html
2017-04-19,How a Warming Planet Drives Human Migration,Climate displacement is becoming one of the world’s most powerful — and destabilizing — geopolitical forces.,"Climate change is not equally felt across the globe, and neither are its longer term consequences. This map overlays human turmoil — represented here by United Nations data on nearly 64 million “persons of concern,” whose numbers have tripled since 2005 — with climate turmoil, represented by data from NASA’s Common Sense Climate Index. The correlation is striking. Climate change is a threat multiplier: It contributes to economic and political instability and also worsens the effects. It propels sudden-onset disasters like floods and storms and slow-onset disasters like drought and desertification; those disasters contribute to failed crops, famine and overcrowded urban centers; those crises inflame political unrest and worsen the impacts of war, which leads to even more displacement. There is no internationally recognized legal definition for “environmental migrants” or “climate refugees,” so there is no formal reckoning of how many have left their homes because climate change has made their lives or livelihoods untenable. In a 2010 Gallup World Poll, though, about 12 percent of respondents — representing a total of 500 million adults — said severe environmental problems would require them to move within the next five years.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/19/magazine/how-a-warming-planet-drives-human-migration.html

The numbers were initially small; but by the middle of July, there were more than 50 victims each week, slumping in doctors’ offices or carried into hospitals comatose or paralyzed from inflammation in their brains. In early August, after nine people died, Dallas County declared a state of emergency: It was caught in an epidemic of what turned out to be West Nile virus, the worst ever experienced by a city in the United States. By the end of the year, 1,162 people had tested positive for the mosquito-borne virus; 216 had become sick enough to be hospitalized; and 19 were dead.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/20/magazine/why-the-menace-of-mosquitoes-will-only-get-worse.html

A visitor can experience two artists’ works separately but in sync, as they were created.","Joan Miró was a small, fastidious, taciturn Catalan. Alexander Calder was a big, rumpled, gregarious American. At first glance, they would appear to hail from distant planets. Yet once they met in Paris in 1928, they enjoyed an unusually close and mutually beneficial friendship that lasted until Calder’s death in 1976. With other artistic pairs, like Pissarro and Cézanne or Picasso and Braque, competitiveness ignited and acrimony at times soured the creative ferment. But Miró and Calder unfailingly championed and nourished each other’s work. A principle that Calder applied to his art could also describe their relationship: “Disparity in form, color, size, weight, motion, is what makes a composition.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/20/arts/design/miro-calder-and-a-convergence-of-constellations.html

2017-04-20,How Singapore Is Creating More Land for Itself,The island off the southern tip of Malaysia reveals the future of building in an epoch of dwindling territory.,"Jurong Island, a man-made smear of sand, lies just off the southern coast of Singapore. A quarter the size of Nantucket, it is thoroughly given over to the petrochemical industry, so crowded with spindly cracking towers and squat oil-storage tanks that the landscape is a blur of brand names — BASF, AkzoNobel, Exxon Mobil, Vopak. One of the island’s most distinctive features, though, remains hidden: the Jurong Rock Caverns, which hold 126 million gallons of crude oil. To get there, you ride an industrial elevator more than 325 feet into the earth, and that brings you to the operations tunnel, a curving space as lofty as a cathedral. It is so long that workers get around on bicycles. Safety goggles mist up with the heat and the humidity; the rock walls, wet from dripping water, look so soft they might have been scooped out of chocolate ice cream. This is as far as anyone — even the workers — can go. The caverns themselves are an additional 100 feet beneath the ocean: two sealed cylindrical vaults, extending away from Jurong. They opened for business in 2014. Next year, three new vaults will be ready.

In the ’80s, an era of triangular fluorescent shoulders and moussed bangs, she sent widow’s weeds trailing down the runway. In the ’90s, her clothes grew tumors that resembled bustles, blurring the lines between illness and beauty, what to look at and what to look away from. While her stores stock simple cotton poplin shirts as well as more challenging lumpen jackets and her runway shows present one-off sculptures, the through-line is a thoughtful rejection of should and a strong feeling of perhaps. The name of her label, which translates to “Like the Boys,” is a quiet, defiant shrug.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/26/magazine/rei-kawakubo-interpreter-of-dreams.html

The gathering was arranged by Peter Staley, the esteemed activist and founder of the Treatment Action Group, which in the 1990s helped speed the development of antiretroviral drugs. The meeting was called to secure the Sanders campaign’s support for a spike in federal spending to combat AIDS, but as the session began, those in attendance were puzzled to find the conversation oddly strained. Sanders’s demeanor, Staley recalled, “was very wary — he was very chilly when we shook hands.” Sanders seemed to be churning internally about something until, dispensing with ceremony, he blurted out: “Let me be blunt.

As Daniel J. Boorstin wrote in his landmark 1961 book THE IMAGE: A Guide to Pseudo-Events in America, fame, which had once been based largely on achievement or on high birth, was becoming more a matter of “a person who is known for his well-knownness.” And the Stork Club was the temple of the high priest of this new cult of fame for fame’s sake, the columnist and broadcaster Walter Winchell, who presided over a mélange of stars, athletes, politicians and the merely notable from the club’s Table 50. In Winchell’s reporting, “The death of ten thousand people in Ethiopia was followed immediately by a Hollywood divorce or romance,” Neal Gabler wrote in his brilliant 1994 biography WINCHELL: Gossip, Power and the Culture of Celebrity. “Dozens of these items raced past listeners each program, not only abutting one another but most given the same urgency and drama. Nothing was differentiated.” Winchell’s reach was enormous. One listener recalled “strolling one Sabbath evening for six blocks through a residential section of Birmingham [Alabama] and never losing a word of W.W.’s broadcast as his voice came through a succession of open windows.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/26/books/review/the-long-view-culture-of-fame-walter-winchell.html

2017-04-26,A Timely Tribute to Abbey Lincoln,The Apollo Theater will host a festival celebrating the jazz vocalist and organizer.,"Known as a jazz vocalist and composer, Abbey Lincoln was also an organizer. Her work has never lost its relevance, but it feels especially pertinent today. Lincoln was living in Harlem in 1962 when she helped to establish the Cultural Association for Women of African Heritage. Her 1966 essay “Who Will Revere the Black Woman?” has been reprinted in various collections over the years. But her music lives the fullest afterlife. Lincoln’s tart drawl earned comparisons to Billie Holiday, but she matched it with a deep, bridling intensity that refused to be displaced. The sharp poetry of her lyrics conveyed only a sliver of her message. From Thursday, May 4 to 7, the Apollo Theater will host a festival of conversations and performances titled “Women of the World.” It culminates on Saturday, May 6, with a concert celebrating Lincoln’s work. The musical director, Terri Lyne Carrington, has assembled three world-class vocalists to honor Lincoln: Dianne Reeves, Dee Dee Bridgewater and Esperanza Spalding.

2017-04-26,‘Why Pictures Now’: Louise Lawler’s Examination of the Art World Comes to MoMA,"As part of the so-called “Pictures Generation” of the 1970s, Ms. Lawler revealed art objects to just be part of a market.","“Why Pictures Now,” a career survey of the New York artist Louise Lawler, has been a long time coming to the Museum of Modern Art. Ms. Lawler was a part of the so-called “Pictures Generation” of the late 1970s, a group of artists who appropriated images from popular culture to consider the mechanisms of value production. She was in some ways the least noticed of the group because she addressed the emperor’s-clothes aspect of art through the least showy filter: She simply took photographs of objects in museums, auction houses and private collections, and revealed them to be the pricey bric-a-brac that they are. Built into her work was a view of art’s fragility — and a sense of our own, which keeps us attached to it. But what does the market care? It’s never been less fragile, and with this MoMA survey, which opens on Sunday, April 30, one of its most astute critics becomes one of the season’s brightest stars.

But that world eventually becomes Gilead, a retrograde and repressive theocratic society in which the title characters wear Amish-like bonnets.

2017-04-28,Elizabeth Warren Really Does Not Like Donald Trump,"“This Fight Is Our Fight,” new on the hardcover nonfiction list, is nominally about the economy. But the index reveals a more personal target.","HER BACK PAGES: You can tell a lot about a book from its index. Consider Elizabeth Warren’s “This Fight Is Our Fight,” reviewed by Paul Krugman and new to the hardcover nonfiction list at No. 1. On its face, the book — subtitled “The Battle to Save America’s Middle Class” — is all about economic issues, and the index is correspondingly flecked with terms like “layoffs” (one citation), “manufacturing decline” (one citation) and “rent assistance” (two citations). But really these are just the parsley on the meatloaf. Flip through the back pages and it’s clear that Warren, the hard-punching Massachusetts senator, has a more personal fight in mind: The index listing for “Trump, Donald” is divided into dozens of subcategories beginning with “bait-and-switch and” (two citations), then moving on to “bigotry and” (four citations), “corporate influences on” (five citations) and “trickle-down and” (seven citations). There are also listings for “tax returns and,” “‘nasty woman’ comment of” and — my favorite — “tweetstorms vs.,” which directs readers to a four-page recap of Warren’s social media battle with Trump during the presidential race. “I tweeted about how he cheated hardworking people who had built his hotels and golf courses,” she recalls. “I mentioned his bullying, his attacks on women, his racism, his obvious narcissism. And in that first tweetstorm, I did my best to sound the alarm: This guy is dangerous, and he could end up as president of the United States.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/books/review/elizabeth-warren-really-does-not-like-donald-trump.html

2017-04-28,7 Key Themes in Rei Kawakubo’s Career,"In advance of the Comme des Garçons designer's exhibition at the Costume Institute, Alexander Fury revisits important ideas in her work. ","In the 1980s, the color black quickly became synonymous with Kawakubo’s aesthetic. When Comme des Garçons made its Paris Fashion Week debut in 1981, the clothes drew attention in their absolute absence of color — an impression that was underlined by interviews with Kawakubo, herself invariably dressed in blacks. Note the plural: Kawakubo used so much, it was possible to see shades and nuances of black in her collections. She wasn’t the first to design in black, of course — Chanel transformed it from a color of mourning into a color of fashion in the 1920s, with her little black dresses, and designers had used it ever since. But by the 1980s, it had fallen out of favor with the rising preference for flashier colors — the brilliant pinks and greens of Claude Montana and Thierry Mugler — and the greiges and navies of Giorgio Armani. Black had never been used with Kawakubo’s severity and insistence — she’s used the word “strength” to describe the color. But in 1988, Kawakubo seemed to abruptly change course: She showed a fall collection dominated by rich scarlet. The thought process behind the decision? “Red is black,” she said at the time. Kawakubo’s challenge to color — and perhaps, as the French theorist Jean Baudrillard reasoned, to the idea of women sporting loud hues being transformed into ‘objects’ — is one of the most important fashion statements of the late 20th century. It transformed black into a color of fashion, intellectualism and rebellion — women who wore her clothes were dubbed “the crows.” And when the Harvard School of Design gave Kawakubo an Excellence in Design Award in 2000, they stated that she “invented” black. Maybe not — but she did reinvent it.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/t-magazine/fashion/rei-kawakubo-comme-des-garcons-themes.html
