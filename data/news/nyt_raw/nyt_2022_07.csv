Almost all the sailors experience a deep unease, “a sense of blasphemy,” at the act of capture: “So close, she was terrifying, a person there, no doubt about it; a trapped and dying woman.” The mermaid, Aycayia — huge, wounded, furious, utterly vulnerable, “crawling with sea-lice” — brings out powerful impulses in the men: to harm, to possess, to touch, to mark her, despite or even because of the hatred in her “tinfoil eyes.” This violent, mesmerizing scene begins “The Mermaid of Black Conch,” signaling the book’s ambition.

2022-07-07,Poem: Sister Song,A longing for and memory of a murdered brother,"The ghazal is a formal poem that has roots in seventh-century Arabia and was often sung by musicians. The poet Agha Shahid Ali introduced the form to America. “Ghazal” literally means “the cry of a gazelle” as it is being chased and about to die. Like many formal poems such as the sonnet, the ghazal, with its restrictions, can paradoxically illuminate and parse difficult emotions. In López’s poem, the emotion is grief — a longing for and memory of a murdered brother. This poem mostly follows the parameters of a ghazal with its repeated end word, “song,” and the inside rhyme of “forever,” “far,” “marred,” etc., as well as the poet’s name or reference to the poet (“Sister”) in the final line. One way this poem breaks the rules is that each couplet doesn’t stand alone as if it were its own poem. Instead, the end of the couplets often bleed into the next stanza, linking the narratives.

But we hold on to the idea that society got “freer” during our generation (whatever that means) because we want our own youthful indiscretions to have “pushed boundaries” (another useless phrase) and “changed the scope of what was possible” (ditto).

The verdict was more severe than that of Elizabeth Holmes, the Theranos founder and chief executive, who in January was convicted of four counts of fraud. It also arrives amid other troubling signs in the start-up world: Tech stock prices have plummeted this year, and investors have become more risk averse.",Business Day,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/10/business/the-week-in-business-start-ups-theranos-fraud.html

The performance gap between Asian American and white high school students on standardized tests has grown over the past decade. In 2018, for example, Asian American students, on average, scored 100 points higher on the SAT than white students. Just three years later, in 2021, that gap had risen by over 25 percent, to 127. Many of the universities that have dropped the SAT requirement have cited a desire for diversity and equity and a de-emphasis on hard-core academic competition. (This has always struck me as errant and, frankly, self-serving reasoning. If elite colleges actually want economically and racially diverse campuses free from the academic stressors that plague high school students, they should take their own advice and stop competing so fiercely to prove that they are the most exclusive places of higher learning in the world.)",Opinion,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/14/opinion/asian-american-student-success.html

In 1793.",John Wood Sweet’s “The Sewing Girl’s Tale” tells the story of an unusual prosecution in 18th-century New York — and its contemporary relevance.,"In the early morning hours of Sept. 5, 1793, a couple of blocks from what is now New York’s City Hall, a gentleman with a reputation as a “rake” raped a 17-year-old seamstress whom he had carried into a brothel by force. No doubt countless cases like this one are lost to history — papers didn’t report on them, records (if anyone kept them) rarely exist, and they rarely went to trial. In fact, in the decade since the end of British rule, there had only been two sexual assault prosecutions in the city of New York. But this case was unusual for several reasons: Lanah Sawyer, the young victim, had the mettle to report the crime. The state prosecuted it vigorously. And an English lawyer newly arrived in America with a personal interest in rape prosecutions (his patron’s son was under indictment for the same) decided to take notes, producing the first published report of such a trial in the United States and the material for “The Sewing Girl’s Tale,” John Wood Sweet’s excellent and absorbing work of social and cultural history.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/14/books/review/the-sewing-girls-tale-john-wood-sweet.html

In a poem called “The First Number Will Be a Blues,” Sommer Browning describes one version of this story: “Before we’re born, my mother tells us, / We watch movies of every life we might be born into. Then we choose. / The little baby points from her / astral cradle.” The speaker marvels at the implications: “I choose that mama. / I choose that daddy. / I choose that irrevocably broken marriage, / That accident that wires my jaw shut, / That burned popcorn” — the litany continues — “That root canal, that unending night on mushrooms, / That dog bite.” “That DUI.” Is it absurd to imagine we select our own pattern of suffering, or that we might have picked a life without any? As Willard Spiegelman notes in his book “Seven Pleasures,” “‘Hap’ means chance.” Happiness and happen share the same root. Whether we choose them or not, the random happenings of our lives, good and bad, are our own. The details that add up to days and years — your street name, your first word, your favorite podcast — have what Ernest Becker might have called a “cosmic specialness.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/20/books/review/chance-design-and-inevitability-in-three-new-poetry-books.html

For more than a century, the neighborhood has been a gathering place for the city’s homeless, its sidewalks often jammed with people sleeping, sometimes setting up encampments for days or longer. A variety of organizations have sprung up to attack root causes — meth addiction, mental illness, lack of housing — but the most reliable meal service came from the River of Life, a charity with a storefront, a few blocks from the harbor, that always draws a line around the block. Spriestersbach was a regular. He would go from the park to the soup kitchen and back again, never without a newsboy cap, never interacting with anyone if he could help it. On that day in May, he was sitting on the sidewalk when a police officer approached him and placed him under arrest. There’d been no altercation, no incident, no fight. Later, he would say he thought it was because he fell asleep in line.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/26/magazine/joshua-spriestersbach-wrongful-incarceration.html

2022-07-26,"Le Rock, From the Frenchette Team, Opens in Rockefeller Center","A Washington, D.C., destination from José Andrés puts down Manhattan roots; a Benoit alumnus anchors a SoHo French restaurant; and more restaurant news.","Every few decades, the reset button is pressed on the restaurants in Rockefeller Center. A big year was 1984, with the openings of the Sea Grill and American Festival Cafe by Restaurant Associates. This year promises to be notable as well, with Tishman Speyer, the company that owns and operates Rockefeller Center, continuing to shape the dining scene. A major addition is Le Rock, Lee Hanson and Riad Nasr’s grand interpretation of a French brasserie. (Mr. Hanson and Mr. Nasr, veterans of Balthazar, own Frenchette in TriBeCa and have Le Veau d’Or on the Upper East Side in the wings.) With Workstead, a Brooklyn interior design studio, they have incorporated enough Art Deco features to anchor the soaring room to its historic setting. A verdigris screen separates the bar, terrazzo floors are new but don’t look it and bare burled wood tables sit at forest-green leather banquettes. Mr. Hanson and Mr. Nasr have to fill 130 seats indoors with another 70 on the terrace, and, to do so, especially with a potential tourist audience, they have given an international spin to the menu. “We’ve gone simpler than Frenchette, which has its own personality,” Mr. Hanson said. Mr. Nasr cited some classic brasserie items, like leeks vinaigrette, escargots, pâté maison and steak au poivre (made with bison). They share a menu, divided into Cette Semaine (weekly specials) and Tout le Temps (every day), which also lists falafel, a brochette of calamari and shishito peppers, and barbajuans, a kind of fried ravioli. Some items play it coy, using untranslated French names, like tablier de sapeur (breaded tripe) and cervelle de canut (fresh herbed cheese). In charge of the kitchen as executive chef is Walker Stern, a former owner of Battersby and Dover in Brooklyn. Mariah Neston is collaborating with Michelle Palazzo, the head pastry chef, on site to create a giant baba au rhum carved tableside. Dinner gets things rolling, with breakfast, which they do not serve at Frenchette, and lunch to follow.",Food,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/26/dining/nyc-restaurant-news.html
