The book’s narrator, who receives 8.5 million British pounds in damages after losing his memory in an accident, is a thumb in the eye of psychological coherence. He has no inwardness, only an obsession: the costly and elaborate re-enactment of half-remembered scenes from his past. These re-enactments, which resemble Situationist pranks, don’t chart a path back to wholeness and authenticity, as the damaged narrator seems to hope (and as the reader weaned on the realist tradition of Austen, Balzac and Henry James might expect).

Now, he has another restaurant ready to make its debut next door. Called Four, it’s in a historic Victorian cottage. (The two restaurants connect by a glass-covered pavilion that functions as an expanded dining room for 2 Spring.) Four has just 10 upholstered seats at a marble counter surrounding a demonstration kitchen done in simple Scandinavian style with blond wood set within the cottage’s white brick and siding. A painting of Anthony Bourdain is a centerpiece on one wall, and a huge Bonnet range equipped with a Japanese charcoal grill helms the kitchen. There, Mr. Schenker will be onstage so to speak, preparing and serving a 10- to 12-course tasting menu, $245, for one of the more elevated dining experiences available on Long Island. Mr. Schenker said he missed the ad hoc menus he used to prepare on Mondays at Recette. “I am thrilled for the opportunity to cook in a similar intimate style for my guests,” he said. Among the dishes he’s planning are an oyster tartlet, langoustine with Champagne essence, rigatoni with giant clam and chiles, foie gras with a duck fat croissant, Mishima Wagyu with wasabi and onion, and chocolate pot de crème. Mr. Schenker’s attention to detail will extend beyond the food and the list for 500 wines (from an underground cellar) to the tableware, with no pieces repeated throughout the dinner. Soon, he will open Provisions, a retail food shop, in a building around the corner. (Opens Thursday)",Food,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/02/dining/new-york-restaurant-openings.html

In northern Spain, for instance, at the cave of Altamira, paintings and engravings were created over a period of at least 10,000 years, between around 25,000 and 15,000 B.C. Presumably, a lot of dramatic events occurred during that period. We have no way of knowing what most of them were. This is of little consequence to most people, since most people rarely think about the broad sweep of human history anyway. They don’t have much reason to. Insofar as the question comes up at all, it’s usually when reflecting on why the world seems to be in such a mess and why human beings so often treat each other badly — the reasons for war, greed, exploitation and indifference to others’ suffering.

But from what I’ve seen on social media she is a Trump supporter, has anti-immigrant views and has an “all lives matter” approach to police violence.

After studying painting at New York’s Grand Central Atelier, she began baking for her friends’ restaurant, Lil’ Deb’s Oasis, in Hudson, N.Y., a few years ago, then started her online business — each one-of-a-kind cake is sold by email from her Manhattan apartment — in 2018 after refining an impasto style that betrays what she calls the “tight” Victorian look of traditional cakes, where lines are clean and excess frosting is swept away. “There’s just so much caution in [that] realist style, and I felt imprisoned by it,” she says. “With cake, I want it to explode.”",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/08/t-magazine/messy-cakes-baking-instagram.html

First up is the son of the province in eastern France: His love letter to his region covers the traditions of farm and table, with the expected tarte flambée, choucroute garnie, baeckeoffe, kougelhopf and a raft of Christmas cookies. Then you have the accomplished chef’s restaurant recipes, often inspired by Alsace, like foie gras terrine with separate steps for sauce, crust and finishing; lamb cooked in hay, requiring six recipes; cabbage stuffed with langoustines and scallops; and the marathon of Black Forest Craquelin that calls for nine preparations. But even at their most complex, the recipes hold promise for the home cook. A button mushroom soup stands deliciously on its own without the chorizo-potato raviolis alongside, and can easily be made to serve four or six instead of 12. And no matter the recipe, Mr. Kreuther fine-tunes the necessary details, even down to explaining the best way to line a terrine with plastic wrap.",Food,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/08/dining/gabriel-kreuther-the-spirit-of-alsace-cookbook.html

2021-11-08,Jacqueline de Jong Paints It All,"At 82, the artist continues to make works that respond to the world around her, whether they comment on the migrant crisis or transform the potatoes she grows in her garden.","The Dutch artist Jacqueline de Jong, 82, lives alone with her cat, Shosha, in a vertiginous central Amsterdam townhouse that she bought with her late husband, Tom Weyland, in 1992. Just before the pandemic, de Jong installed an elevator to ease her climb to the attic, where she keeps a painting studio tucked under the eaves. Going up and down in that lift — a “little prison,” she says — got her thinking about the tension between movement and confinement, a theme already on her mind as she watched the news, horrified by the unfolding refugee crises in Idlib, Syria, and the Mediterranean. It’s a testament to de Jong’s eclectic sensibility that she braided those thoughts together in a new body of work: “Border-Line,” a series of oil-stick paintings that mash up news imagery of the global migrant crisis — the rescue boat Sea Watch 4, huddled masses on rafts, fire at the Mória refugee camp on the island of Lesbos — with the kind of monstrous, cartoonish figures that frequently appear on her canvases. Here, they are ghostly lugs, hovering at the edge of the action, sometimes encased in little elevatorlike boxes (that de Jong made these paintings during Covid lockdown — “very much in confinement” — adds another layer). The series reflects her “personal desire to do something” about the migrant situation, but these ungainly interlopers seem to sound a note of self-critique: Like the artist and her presumed viewer, they empathize and gawk in equal measure.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/08/t-magazine/jacqueline-de-jong-art-border-line.html

They were together for decades, but she was never beloved by the three stepchildren, and she never had children of her own. A person she considers a “nephew” lives in the same city we do and encouraged her to move to be near him.

We assisted her in moving across the country, and she is residing in a very nice senior community. We manage her finances and health care and visit a few times a month. The “nephew” does visit her, but nothing more, and has asked for financial support a few times since she moved. She is not an easy person in some regards; for example, she broods about perceived slights and then wants to change her will to cut out the person she feels slighted her (this is a chronic issue).

My notes from the meeting simply say, “NIKOLE: special issue on the 400th anniversary of African slaves coming to U.S.,” a milestone that was approaching that August. This wasn’t the first time Nikole had brought up 1619. As an investigative journalist who often focuses on racial inequalities in education, Nikole has frequently turned to history to explain the present. Sometimes, reading a draft of one of her articles, I’d ask if she might include even more history, to which she would remark that if I gave her more space, she would be happy to take it all the way back to 1619. This was a running joke, but it was also a reflection of how Nikole had been cultivating the idea for what became the 1619 Project for many years. Following that January meeting, she led an editorial process that over the next six months developed the idea into a special issue of the magazine, a special section of the newspaper and a multiepisode podcast series. Next week we are publishing a book that expands on the magazine issue and represents the fullest expression of her idea to date.

And it was always the same kind: white, short-grain Japanese rice, polished and glossy, pleasantly clumpy and quick to yield between the teeth, clinging to the chopstick, sticking to the spoon. In adulthood, when rice became a kind of decadence, sacrificed in adherence to a supposedly healthier, definitely less satisfying low-carb diet, the mere scent of it made me wistful — how much easier life seemed before rice became so complicated.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/11/t-magazine/travel-rice.html

2021-11-11,The Thrilling Dare of Scorched Rice,"When browned on the bottom of the pot by a skilled cook, the grain is transformed into a complex delicacy, one prized by food cultures around the world.","IT TAKES NERVE to scorch rice, to get a proper crust at the bottom of the pot, that layer of grains cooked past their time, bronzed and crisped but stopped just shy of burning; to go almost too far. You can’t see what’s happening. All that’s visible if you lift the lid is the soft, yielding rice on top, fluffy and preening. But don’t lift the lid, and don’t stir. Maybe you tuck a towel around the rim for a tighter seal to catch drips of condensation; maybe you flick the flame up high, lean in to hear the last rustle of water boiling off, then shut down the burner and let the pot be, sitting there ticking in the fading heat. You have to rely on your sense of smell to recognize when the gorgeous scent of roasting is near its peak — when it hits that note of popcorn just bursting to life, kernels turning themselves inside out, or of hot chestnuts from street carts in winter, tossed in woks with tiny black stones and shucked of their sleeves — to save it before it ends in bitterness. Your reward: rice’s dark side, its alter ego, grains gone hard and sealed together, chewy and crunchy and sublime.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/11/t-magazine/scorched-burnt-rice.html

But some locals are trying to change that.,"NEAR MIDNIGHT, AT the top of a lighthouse in Dakar, the westernmost point of the African continent, I sat before a grilled whole fish as long as my forearm and accompanied by a dome of rice. Thiof, a white grouper, is such common Senegalese restaurant fare that the Wolof word itself is slang — a handsome man is also a thiof, a “good catch.” I’d eaten beachside thiof south of Dakar in the vacation area of Saly, and cliffside thiof at breezy restaurants in Les Almadies, the Dakar neighborhood known for its nightlife. This thiof, though rubbed with spices like the others — I tasted ginger, garlic, cardamom, maybe turmeric — was served with a tiny cup of warm tamarind glaze. If there were vegetables on the plate, I have banished them from my memory; only the sauce, fish and rice were in conversation. The skin of the thiof was crisp and juicy, the sauce tangy and rich. The rice was not as long as basmati, nor as short as sticky rice, but a size in between, round through the middle with little adhesion and a firm but pliant texture. If food encapsulates pleasure, innovation and community all at once, then tasting the Platonic ideal of a simple dish can bring a place and its people into focus, even if you encounter that ideal in an unlikely setting — a lighthouse restaurant known for its brunch.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/11/t-magazine/senegal-homegrown-rice.html

We flew over pleated hills that formed a girdle around the Oaxaca valley, one of the most fertile variegated soils in the world. The earth was stamped with cloud shadows that gave an impression both of movement and fixity — a rich, dark earth with an inner seam that showed red and metallic in places. The shadow of the plane, like a fighter escort, followed us as we descended, then was subsumed by the rain-drenched tarmac. The sky was full of light. Leaving the small white airport, we passed a palisade of organ pipe cactuses. There was blue-leaved agave in the traffic islands and, lining the streets, the trees of my childhood in Delhi — flamboyant, laburnum, jacaranda — were in flower. A nondescript modern town of brightly shuttered shops, auto repair and signs that read “aluminio y vidrio” gave way to a fully intact Spanish colonial town from the 16th century. “Downtown: local people,” my driver said, observing the change, “centro histórico for foreign people.”",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/11/t-magazine/mexico-rice-conquest.html

In Greek, the word “wreath” is diadema, or “diadem”; in Latin, it became known as a corona, or “crown.” But these first wreaths weren’t just for ceremonial coronations. Some were cut from gold to resemble myrtle and were worn as headdresses by royals and the elite to mark their social rank and stature. Others were said to have been hung by despairing Grecian suitors on the doors of their unrequited loves, these gestures of devotion and longing echoing Apollo’s own relentless pursuit of the river nymph Daphne, who was transformed into a laurel tree after pleading with her father, the river god Peneus, to rescue her.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/22/t-magazine/contemporary-wreaths-female-florists.html

Standing properly — and improving posture in general — can help prevent back pain, which persistently afflicts some 16 million American adults, according to data published by Georgetown University. “You might see people, as they grow older, they start to bend over, with the spine collapsing, and they’re staring at the ground while they’re walking — they can’t stand upright anymore,” Murphy says. Plant your feet about hip distance apart; the weight on each foot should feel the same. Establish equilibrium by spreading the pinkie toe as far away from the big toe as possible. “You can feel how weight might shift a little bit from the inside of your foot, to the outside, the front to the back,” says Murphy, who considers standing pose to be central in most of the classes he teaches. Next, bring your feet together so your big toes and heels touch. This action forces your muscles to engage in balancing you.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/23/magazine/standing-yoga.html

The encounter was more drudgery than mystery, I’m afraid. Twenty years ago, my doctoral supervisor casually informed me that I would need to read every tragedy written in English up to 1623. He said this as if it were a blessing — at least I wouldn’t have to read all the comedies. The total came to somewhere around 300 plays. I read one in the morning and one in the afternoon, five days a week, for the better part of a year, and they were mostly lousy as hell. But after I read all those lousy plays, I reread all of Shakespeare, and then, when something by Shakespeare was in front of me, his ghost entered the room. By sheer familiarity, by grinding through text and context, I came to know his presence.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/24/books/review/shakespeare-cohere-natural-language-processing.html

Peck was a mechanical engineer by training with a specialty in fluid mechanics; Banyai was a semiconductor expert who had worked in genomics since the mid-2000s, facilitating the transition from old-school Sanger sequencing, which processes a single DNA fragment at a time, to next-generation sequencing, which works through millions of fragments simultaneously. When the chemistry was miniaturized and put on a silicon chip, reading DNA became fast, cheap and widespread. The Bills, who met when Banyai hired Peck to work on a genomics project, realized that there was an opportunity to do something analogous for writing DNA — to make the process of making synthetic genes more scalable and cost-effective.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/24/magazine/gene-synthesis.html

A few months later, on a cold February morning, the designer presented his first haute couture collection in the townhouse’s Trianon gray Louis XVI-style salons to an audience of buyers and fashion editors. “In 1947, after so many years of wandering,” Dior writes in his 1956 autobiography, “couture was weary of only catering [to] painters and poets, and wanted to revert to its true function, of clothing women and enhancing their beauty.” The clothes he designed, as he puts it, were “for flowerlike women, with rounded shoulders, full feminine busts and hand-span waists.” Among the silhouettes in his debut Corolle line (named after the botanical term for flower petals), one in particular stood out: the Bar Jacket. Constructed in cream silk shantung, the veste was sculpted to fit snugly above a narrow waist, then flare into a scalloped basque, which was meticulously padded, stiffened and weighted to accentuate the hipline. Paired with a very full skirt, it was dubbed the New Look by the press — and set off a sartorial revolution.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/25/t-magazine/dior-bar-jacket.html

In Miyazaki’s world, people and creatures are often transformed: wizard into bird, human into pig, river spirit into dragon.
