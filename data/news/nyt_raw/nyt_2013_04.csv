But when the topic of conversation turned to David Lynch, the “Blue Velvet” and “Mulholland Dr.” filmmaker, a certain gleam appeared in his eye. Over the next several minutes, Louis C.

I missed the punk scene by about two years because I was a hippie. Punks hated hippies. At least that’s what John Holmstrom told me years after hippiedom and punkdom had run their respective courses. Holmstrom was a co-founder — along with Ged Dunn Jr. and Eddie “Legs” McNeil — as well as an editor, designer, illustrator and letterer of Punk, the magazine that helped put the music on the map. When I was art director of The New York Times Op-Ed page, he showed me his illustration portfolio.

An answer begins to take shape when his sister, an affluent stay-at-home mom who has never strayed far from their childhood home in Delaware, organizes a family trip to Santa Cecilia, the village in Italy where their parents grew up. For all of the Grassos, the very idea of the trip stirs up thoughts of old losses, ghosts that shadow the present, prompted by the dissonant fact that like many if not most Italian-Americans, Antonio and Mad­dalena Grasso enshrined in their children a glowing image of things Italian yet never took them to Italy or even taught them the language. Feeling oneself “at the end of something,” this slyly ambitious novel suggests, may well be the existential condition of being Italian-American.

Nor is the jacket of service; it shows a couple of old movie tickets when it needs a scrum of characters, not getting anywhere but being their talkative and irrepressible selves. I’d guess that this novel — Owen King’s first, after an esteemed story collection — was compiled over a period of years, possibly as a series of short stories about a group of characters. The novel is maybe a third too long, chiefly because as he wanders around King can hardly see a place, a face or a chair without embarking on a wordy, if not literary, description of it. This might have been cut by someone (why not King?) who can see that brevity is his best quality. But he may be a tricky man to edit or organize. He should persevere, for when he is good — and that is often enough to make a page turner of this book — he has a captivating energy, a precision and a fondness for people that are rare and that make the reader doubly impatient for him to do what he does best.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/07/books/review/double-feature-by-owen-king.html

2013-04-05,. . . Congress Disposes,"To fight World War II, Roosevelt needed support from legislators who wanted to keep out Europe’s Jews.","Franklin Roosevelt enjoyed the overwhelming support of American Jews during his presidency, and the reasons are clear. In his three-plus terms from 1933 to 1945, he led the war against Hitler, supported a Jewish homeland in Palestine, appointed a Jew to the Supreme Court, chose another to be his secretary of the Treasury and surrounded himself with Jewish advisers who helped shape the laws that revolutionized the role of government in American life — what some critics sneeringly called the “Jew Deal.” Then, of course, there was Eleanor Roosevelt, whose concern for minorities fused the bond even tighter.

Still, if there is one salubrious thing “about these insalubrious afflictions, such as Ebola and West Nile and AIDS and the influenzas,” it’s that “they remind us, by spilling over from nonhuman animals to humans, that we humans are just another animal.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/07/books/review/up-front.html

Even his ending was vintage Chávez. The perpetual showman spent the last months of his life ruling Venezuela Oz-like, by remote control from his sickbed (he even missed his own inauguration on Jan. 10). All of which makes this the perfect time for the release of Rory Carroll’s “Comandante: Hugo Chávez’s Venezuela,” a sort of political obituary for the self-declared savior of Venezuela — a charismatic champion of the poor who, during his 14 years in office, ground one of Latin America’s richest states into the dust.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/07/books/review/comandante-hugo-chavezs-venezuela-by-rory-carroll.html

Grandeur was his nature. He aroused adulation. He dealt a few preliminary military defeats to the Spanish imperial army, and in 1813, he entered victoriously, for the moment, into Caracas on a chariot drawn by white-gowned daughters of the leading families, as if he were a god or a Caesar. And he assumed the magnificent title of “Liberator and Dictator.” The chariot and the daughters deviated, it is true, from the austere Washington style, and the dictatorial honorific has hovered a little ominously over his reputation ever since, as you can see by reading Marie Arana’s admiring and rueful biography, “Bolívar.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/07/books/review/bolivar-by-marie-arana.html

My own case dates to my mid-20s, when I discovered Peter Nadas’s novel “A Book of Memories.” Its high-Modernist aspirations were just one of the ways this contemporary masterpiece seemed to issue from a more distinguished past. Fascinated, I began reading every living Hungarian novelist I could find in English: Imre Kertesz, Laszlo Krasznahorkai. . . .

2013-04-05,Vain Glorious | Olfactive Studio,Experience the connection between visual elements and scents with Olfactive Studio’s new collection of fragrances.,"“Images and perfumes have always been linked,” says Céline Verleure, a 20-year fragrance industry veteran based in Paris. “When we smell a perfume, it gives us images in our heads, like a landscape or a scene.” A few years ago, she decided to explore this relationship further by asking perfumers to collaborate with photographers on a series of eau de parfums inspired by the visual artists’ works. Thus, Olfactive Studio was born, and the French brand’s five highly concentrated unisex scents arrive in the United States on April 8. “The perfumers are able to create on a spiritual level. Olivier Cresp, who worked on the Flash Back fragrance with the photographer Laurent Segretier, says there’s a new and special freedom in starting with the visual,” Verleure notes. Her current favorite in the lineup is Lumière Blanche, a milky yet fresh and spicy concoction from the perfumer Sidonie Lancesseur, who drew her inspiration from the famed photographer Massimo Vitali’s picture of sunbathers gathered on the ivory-hued Scala dei Turchi cliff in southern Sicily. To fully experience the connection between the visual and olfactory elements, Verleure suggests first choosing a scent based on the image, which adorns the fragrance box, and then smelling the juice second. “Pick the photo that gives you the most emotion, and you will really like that perfume. It works!” she says.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/04/05/vain-glorious-olfactive-studio/

The collection, which will be on view April 9 and 10 at Prada’s exhibition space at Via Fogazzaro 36, consists of pieces that address the increasingly blurred boundaries between working and living space by being kinetic rather than static. As Koolhaas said, his goal was to create furniture “that performs in very precise but also in completely unpredictable ways” and indeed, flexibility is the key here. A massive, heavily engineered piece called the 04 Counter consists of three horizontal bars that stack like a wall, but which can also pivot and cantilever, transforming the piece from room divider to “piazza,” as Benjamin Pardo, Knoll’s design director, called it, adding, “Once people discover that the object moves, they want to engage with it.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/04/05/paradigm-shift-tools-for-life/

(Cinemax) DARK SHADOWS (2012) Johnny Depp, above, summons the spirit of the romantic vampire hero Barnabas Collins in Tim Burton’s revisiting of a 1960s daytime soap opera. Eva Green plays the maid Angelique, who paws at Barnabas’s body. Bella Heathcote is Josette, who runs off with his heart. Three’s a crowd, and the witchy Angelique casts a spell that leaves Josette dead and Barnabas bereft — and leads to a timeout in a deep grave, where, after 200 years of entombment, he awakes in 1972, like a thirstier Rip Van Winkle. “Barnabas’s liberation does the same for Mr. Depp’s performance, and it’s delightful to watch how the actor handles the vampire’s readjustment to the world of the living, which, after he has thrown back some invigorating human Slurpees and faced down a ‘demon’ (a car), he does with both lofty entitlement and abject bewilderment,” Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times. “ ‘Dark Shadows’ isn’t among Mr. Burton’s most richly realized works, but it’s very enjoyable, visually sumptuous and, despite its lugubrious source material and a sporadic tremor of violence, surprisingly effervescent,” she added. “And while there may not be any deeper resonance lurking in his ‘Dark Shadows’ — the show first surfaced in the middle of the Vietnam War, when real horror was playing out daily in the news — Mr. Burton’s gift for deviant beauty and laughter has its own liberating power.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/06/arts/television/whats-on-saturday.html

2013-04-07,A Catalog Will Detail Hirst’s Spot Paintings,The publisher Other Criteria will issue a comprehensive catalog of the paintings this spring.,"Damien Hirst’s whimsical work evokes amusement, fascination and annoyance among art lovers, seemingly in equal measure. His spot paintings, which he began in 1986, have particularly been lightning rods. These panels of bright-hued spots are usually arranged in columns on canvases of different shapes, and his fans have paid as much as $3.4 million for them. Last year the Gagosian Gallery mounted an exhibition, “The Complete Spot Paintings 1986-2011,” at 11 galleries in eight cities. But the show’s expansive title notwithstanding, it presented only 331 works — a fraction of the spot-painting output of Mr. Hirst. The full scope of Mr. Hirst’s fascination with colored dots will become clear this spring, when his publisher, Other Criteria, issues a comprehensive catalog of the paintings: a 1,000-page illustrated book listing every work. Jason Beard, the director of Other Criteria, told The Art Newspaper that there are about 1,400 of the works. Mr. Hirst painted the first 25 himself; the others have been mainly entrusted to his assistants. Other Criteria’s catalog already offers for sale a number of items derived from the paintings, including magnets, a T-shirt, cuff links and a spot garbage bin.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/08/arts/design/a-catalog-will-detail-hirsts-spot-paintings.html

The Havana Times reported that the couple also visited a dance troupe, Danza Contemporánea de Cuba, the singer Haila Mompié and the children’s theater group La Colmenita, and met with students and teachers at the Superior Art Institute. They may soon be explaining the trip to members of Congress, or facing a prison sentence and a fine. Treasury Department regulations prohibit Americans from traveling to Cuba “unless authorized by a general or specific license.” Now two Republican members of the House of Representatives from Florida — which has a large population of Cuban refugees and where feelings about Cuba are acute — have raised questions about the visit. The representatives, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen and Mario Diaz-Balart, have written to Adam J. Szubin, the director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control at the Treasury Department, asking about the nature of the license the couple received for their visit. “Cuba’s tourism industry is wholly state-controlled,” Ms. Ros-Lehtinen and Mr. Diaz-Balart wrote, “therefore, U.S. dollars spent on Cuban tourism directly fund the machinery of oppression that brutally represses the Cuban people.” Penalties for violating the travel ban can include a 10-year prison sentence and a $250,000 fine. Although thousands of Americans find their way to Cuba every year, usually by way of another country, few are prosecuted.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/08/arts/music/questions-over-cuba-trip-of-beyonce-and-jay-z.html

Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, concluding a visit to Moscow, was pitted against three of the state-controlled media’s most polished propagandists. For 50 minutes, she tied them in knots, shifting between firm diplomacy and patient, school-marmish exposition, with – whenever one of the interviewers tried to interrupt – flashes of Trunchbull discipline. Even by the standards of the day – Mikhail Gorbachev’s cascade of glasnost, the thawing of the Cold War – the Thatcher interview was amazing. She articulated a peace-through-strength line on nuclear and conventional arms control, disclosing along the way facts that Soviet viewers had never read or heard in their media about their own arsenals. (A transcript is here.) She heaped praise on Gorbachev but, at a time when Gorbachev and President Reagan were indulging in talk about a world without nuclear weapons, Thatcher explained to viewers the European view that only nuclear deterrence had sustained 40 years of peace.

The plot this time concerns a young journalist and his girlfriend, a graduate student, who have been investigating a sex-trafficking ring with patrons high up the political chain. “It is Ms. Rapace’s fierce and sly performance, more than the themes or the plot, that sustains ‘The Girl Who Played With Fire,’ ” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. “Without her, it would be a not bad procedural, touching on some knotty contemporary issues and infused with a paranoia that is at once unsettling and comforting.” But, he added, “Ms. Rapace, tiny and agile, her steely rage showing now and then the tiniest crack of vulnerability, belongs to another dimension altogether.

2013-04-10,What’s On Wednesday,Television highlights.,"9 P.M. (BBC America) SPIES OF WARSAW In the conclusion of this two-part mini-series based on the novel by Alan Furst, Col. Jean-François Mercier (David Tennant, foreground above), a French military attaché in Warsaw, goes undercover in Czechoslovakia as he searches for the man who can lead him into the Nazi war machine. Anna Skarbek (Janet Montgomery), his mistress and a lawyer for the League of Nations, receives devastating news about her former lover, the Russian journalist Maxim Mostov (Piotr Baumann), and flees to Spain on a mission of mercy. The drama “has an almost comic-book adherence to stereotype, from the dashing Polish nobleman to the sallow, pockmarked Nazi border guard,” Alessandra Stanley wrote in The New York Times. “On the other hand, there is nothing more satisfying than a prewar espionage story that shows, up close and told-you-so, how most of Europe slept through Hitler’s rise.” She added, “There are many impediments to true love in ‘Spies of Warsaw,’ but Mercier, solitary and sorrowful, learns to trust his heart — and not the Maginot Line.” ",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/10/arts/television/whats-on-wednesday.html

2013-04-10,Anthony Weiner and Huma Abedin’s Post-Scandal Playbook,Taking the plunge back into public life after a marital (and political) catastrophe.,"One day in early February, I met Anthony Weiner and Huma Abedin for breakfast at the Gramercy Park Hotel, one of their regular joints, just a few blocks from their apartment on Park Avenue South. The first thing Weiner said when I sat down was that their 13-month-old son, Jordan, had just moments ago taken his first step. They were both giddy, kvelling with baby-pride, especially Weiner, who, with all his free time, has become his son’s primary caretaker. This is what life is like now for the man whose name is invariably followed in print by some version of “the disgraced former congressman who sent out a lewd picture of himself via Twitter.” He seems to spend much of his time within a five-block radius of his apartment: going to the park with Jordan; picking up his wife’s dry cleaning and doing the grocery shopping; eating at his brother Jason’s two restaurants in the neighborhood. This is what happens after a scandal: Ranks are closed and the world shrinks to a tiny dot. It is a life in retreat. And for a man who was known, pre-scandal, for his overweening ambition, his constant presence on cable news, his hard-charging schedule that verged on lunacy, well, it has been quite a change.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/14/magazine/anthony-weiner-and-huma-abedins-post-scandal-playbook.html

Instead of ink, each stamp has a unique dot pattern that triggers an artistic effect when placed against the iPad’s screen. Want to add a swimming dolphin? Use the sticker stamp. Want to make your dolphin move? Use the Arrow stamp, and trace a course. After you snap your iPad into the holder and download the free app, called ArtSee Studio, your child is free to sketch. One weak point — our testers found it hard to “undo” a sticker once it has been placed. But they were impressed by the powerful drawing options, which include such wonders as a rainbow crayon. Saving projects is automatic, and there is a set of games like connect the dots and concentration.  The case fits all generations of iPads.Download the app here.",Technology,https://gadgetwise.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/04/10/the-ipad-as-childs-easel/

Since his father died when he had just turned 6, he had to base his model less on memory than on myth. His father was a Chicago newspaperman, and so Hainey romanticized the bygone world of Chicago newspapermen. He venerated good reporting. He drank Scotch on the rocks. He sensed secrets in his childhood home. His mother told him his father had died of a heart attack. “I had to pry this out of her,” Hainey writes in “After Visiting Friends.” She was vague about the circumstances. “All my life,” he says, “I’ve felt the story I was told about how my father died did not add up.” An obituary mentioned that his father had been visiting friends: who? It also mentioned a strange address: where had his father gone, and why?

A seated woman — hand at her jaw, skin etched with worry — looks into the middle distance. Children rest their heads on her shoulders, faces turned away; an infant lies bundled in her lap. By capturing the plight of California’s ­Depression-era migrant workers, Dorothea Lange’s “Migrant Mother” transformed a nation’s attitudes toward the poor from the moment of its publication in 1936. Today, its immediacy dulled by time and fame, it functions mainly as a visual metonym for the Great Depression.

2013-04-12,What’s On Friday,Television highlights.,"8 P.M. (Sundance) ADAPTATION (2002) The director Spike Jonze and the writer Charlie Kaufman (along with his imaginary twin, Donald, who is also credited with writing the screenplay) journey into metafiction in this movie about the two Kaufmans (Nicolas Cage, in both roles) and Susan Orlean (Meryl Streep), a writer for The New Yorker whose book “The Orchid Thief” inspired the film. Chris Cooper won an Oscar for best supporting actor for his role as an orchid obsessive; Ms. Streep and Mr. Cage (above) also received Oscar nominations. “ ‘Adaptation’ is, most obviously, a movie about itself, as gleefully self-referential an exercise in auto-deconstruction as you could wish,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. “But it is also, more deeply, a movie about its own nonexistence — a narrative that confronts both the impossibility and the desperate necessity of storytelling, and that short-circuits our expectations of coherence, plausibility and fidelity to lived reality even as it satisfies them. Common sense suggests that there could never be such a movie, but if there could, it would have to be one of the slipperiest, most fascinating and, by any sane reckoning, best movies of the year.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/12/arts/television/whats-on-friday.html

2013-04-12,Development and Its Discontent,Street traffic is exploding in Cambodia. And no one can keep up.,"PHNOM PENH — In 2010, the Cambodian government unveiled with great fanfare the country’s first traffic overpass. The $6 million project — lit with a futuristic blue neon swoosh — was intended to ease congestion where a major boulevard that runs north-south through Phnom Penh intersects with twin bridges that cross the Bassac River, just to the east. Prime Minister Hun Sen called the Sky Bridge Project a “great achievement” and proclaimed that it would end traffic problems in the area.It wasn’t long before commuters discovered a catch: By making it easier for motorists traveling north-south to keep going straight, the new overpass made it impossible for them to turn left onto the intersecting east-west road. The result is a mess. Now, drivers heading south who want to cross the river must first take a right and drive away for several hundred meters and then make a U-turn and head back. And motorists heading north are forced to turn right, which necessarily takes them onto the bridges — meaning that they are forced to cross the river, turn around and cross the river again. Congestion in the area is worse than ever, and the traffic more dangerous.",Opinion,https://latitude.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/04/12/development-and-its-discontent/

Day, who finished tied for second at the 2011 Masters, had never topped the leader board overnight at a major. Day is one shot ahead of his countryman Marc Leishman and the American veteran Fred Couples, who are tied for second at five under. Angel Cabrera, Jim Furyk, and Brandt Snedeker are tied for fourth at four under.  Tiger Woods, who had his back nine derailed by a severe bounce off the flag pole on No. 15, is part of a seven-way tie for seventh. As the day wrapped up, most eyes were on the middle-to-bottom part of the scoreboard, as the cut line hovered around the name of 14-year-old Guan Tianlang of China, who just barely survived with a score of four over.   Guan would have advanced more comfortably had he not been assessed a rare stroke penalty for slow play on the 17th hole.  Despite the unusual ruling, Guan did not take opportunities offered to him by Tom Rinaldi of ESPN to criticize or bemoan the controversial ruling.  “I respect their decision,” he said. ",Sports,https://onpar.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/04/12/day-2-live-updates-from-the-masters/

Using the tiny kitchen of her Central Park West apartment as a lab, she cooked potions in a double boiler and compounded dyes on a countertop. Sometimes so much dust escaped from her experiments that the butter in her refrigerator turned red. Lipstick had existed for centuries, of course, but Bishop hoped to create a long-lasting version for the modern woman, one that would stand up to the friction of coffee cups, cigarettes and kisses. She hit on a formula made with lanolin and dyes that penetrated deep into the skin. To demonstrate its sticking power, she persuaded her neighborhood druggist to decorate his hand with streaks of her lipstick.

In this latest installment of “American Vampire,” Mr. Snyder has been blessed with two gifted collaborators: Rafael Albuquerque, the original series artist, and Dustin Nguyen, who illustrates a spin-off story included in this collection. Though vampires have seemingly given up their number one status in pop culture to zombies, Mr. Snyder proves there are still plenty of tales to tell about these creatures of the night. Mr. Nguyen lends his wonderfully expressive and moody art to an adventure involving the hunt for the granddaddy of all vampires, Dracula, while Mr. Albuquerque illustrates the exploration of all things related to Skinner Sweet, the first American vampire, who is more vicious and less bothered by sunlight. The only drawback to reading this book in collected form is that the reader does not get to long savor the cliffhangers with which Mr. Snyder ends most issues.

2013-04-12,The Taste Divide,In this issue we feature images that we hope open your eyes to new ideas of taste and beauty as they have ours.,"How does an actress design her image? In our celebrity-obsessed culture, she usually dresses in the very latest fashion and has her photographs airbrushed into superhuman oblivion. Julianne Moore, while she indeed looks ravishing in films and on the red carpet, and even in her sweatpants at morning drop off (where I see her from time to time as our children attend the same school), is not such an actress. She is someone who rather pushes the boundaries in her acting in order to inhabit the characters she plays. For this issue she collaborated with the photographers Inez and Vinoodh and the makeup wizard Peter Philips, all artists in their own right, who seek to extend our way of seeing. Here they show us a more real, and even exaggerated side of Moore’s natural beauty. Freckled from birth (and not in a cute way, she explains in the piece), Moore’s face was sprinkled by Philips with even more spots. The resulting image, unlike most cover shots, isn’t retouched to perfection. The power comes from Moore’s striking and honest intensity, and from her scarcely made-up face, remarkable and beautiful at age 52.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/04/12/the-taste-divide/

The national government and armed forces oppose the use of the banner, citing multiple national laws against separatism.

2013-04-16,What’s On Tuesday,Television highlights.,"9 P.M. (13, 49) THE CENTRAL PARK FIVE (2012) The directors Ken Burns, David McMahon and Sarah Burns revisit the case of the Central Park jogger, a 28-year-old white woman who was found in the park very early on April 20, 1989, bound, gagged, nearly naked and nearly dead, and the five black and Latino teenagers who were arrested (above, Yusef Salaam, one of the accused). They argue that the convictions, and the years the defendants served for the attack, of which they were eventually absolved last year, constituted a second, racially motivated crime. “Equal measures criminal investigation, cultural exhumation and a consideration of race in a presumptively postracial America, it seeks to set the record straight,” Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times. “Measured in tone and outraged in its argument, it is an emotionally stirring, at times crushingly depressing cinematic call to witness. It’s also frustrating because while it re-examines the assault on the jogger and painstakingly walks you through what happened to the teenagers — from their arrest through their absolution — it fails to add anything substantively new. If you followed the news, the story will be familiar; if you lived in New York in 1989, it may also feel incomplete.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/16/arts/television/whats-on-tuesday.html

2013-04-17,Bring On the Next Marathon,We’re just not afraid anymore.,"Looking at scenes of the Boston sidewalk a few hours after Monday’s bombing — torn clothing, bloodstains, shards of glass — I found my mind going back to a similar sidewalk in Tel Aviv in September 2003. A Hamas suicide bomber had blown himself up at a bus stop outside the Tsrifin army base, and by coincidence I was nearby and got there to witness the immediate aftermath. As I wrote then, parts of the bomber were still on the street, including his hairy leg. His shoe had been blown off, but his brown sock was still daintily on his foot. Israeli rescue workers calmly carried away the dead on stretchers, with an odd mix of horror and routine. But what I remember most was something the police spokesman said to me: “We will have this whole area cleaned up in two hours. By morning, the bus stop will be repaired. You will never know this happened.”",Opinion,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/17/opinion/friedman-bring-on-the-next-marathon.html

2013-04-17,Florida: Teachers Sue Over Evaluation System,Seven Florida teachers have brought a federal lawsuit to protest job evaluation policies that tether individual performance ratings to the test scores of students who are not even in their classes.," Seven Florida teachers have brought a federal lawsuit to protest job evaluation policies that tether individual performance ratings to the test scores of students who are not even in their classes. The suit, which was filed Tuesday in conjunction with three local affiliates of the National Education Association in Federal District Court for the Northern District of Florida in Gainesville, says Florida’s two-year-old evaluation system violates teachers’ rights of due process and equal protection. Under a 2011 law, schools and districts must evaluate teachers in part based on how much their students learn, as measured by standardized tests. But since Florida, like most states, administers only math and reading tests and only in selected grades, many teachers do not teach tested subjects. One of the plaintiffs, a first-grade teacher, was rated on the basis of test scores of students in a different school in her district, and another, who teaches vocational classes to aspiring health care workers, was rated based on test scores of students in grades and subjects she had never taught. “This lawsuit highlights the absurdity of the current evaluation system,” said Andy Ford, president of the Florida Education Association.

2013-04-17,Vain Glorious | Aqua Spin Classes,"A fitness fad that’s swept over France, has just landed stateside.","Aqua spinning, the fitness fad that’s swept over France, has just landed stateside with the newly opened Aqua Studio in TriBeCa. As the name implies, there are elements taken from traditional spinning — fat-blasting and calorie-burning moves, upbeat soundtracks, and friendly (but firm) instructors — but there are also benefits that only exercising in water can boast. For starters, there’s the draw of a low-impact, high-resistance workout. The water supports your body weight and reduces stress on joints while generating resistance, which encourages your legs to move in a safe and controlled manner. Devotees also claim that aqua spinning can help smooth dimpled thighs. Aqua Studio’s founder Esther Gauthier, a French expat, says, “Moving in water generates a natural massage that drains the lymphatic system and improves the appearance of cellulite.” But most important, being in the water is simply fun. There’s something about throwing on a bathing suit and splashing in water that takes the typical emotional edge off of exercising: your muscles are getting a serious workout, while your mind feels buoyant and light. After my first session, I felt rejuvenated and energized, not wiped out (like I do after an intense run), and left the studio with a spring in my step.

Though he makes other styles, including a fetching Cuban-heeled boot for men, de Havilland will forever be associated with the platform, which he learned to make at his father’s knee; his parents had a shoe business that catered to showgirls in postwar London, and it was those original designs that prompted him to resuscitate the platform for the glam rock generation and again more recently for customers like Kate Moss. “I think they empower women,” he says. “They give you your own little stage to stand on.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/04/17/terry-de-havilland/

Some translators have captured facets of the poem’s magic, but always at a cost: Charles Singleton conveys Dante’s erudition but flattens his poetry; John Ciardi recreates his music but takes mammoth liberties with the original; and John Sinclair’s “thees” and “thous” date his otherwise deft rendering. If the translator’s task is “to liberate the language imprisoned in a work,” as Walter Benjamin writes, then few literary strongholds come as heavily fortified as “The Divine Comedy.” Written in Dante’s native Tuscan instead of the more prestigious Latin, the poem and its earthy idiom, copious allusions and otherworldy precision burden translators, especially in rhyme-poor English, which struggles to match the momentum of Dante’s terza rima and internal rhymes. No wonder that Dante’s latest translator, the eminent Australian poet and critic Clive James, feared his task would be “thankless.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/21/books/review/dantes-divine-comedy-translated-by-clive-james.html

It still felt like downtown, and for a kid raised in the suburb known as the Upper East Side, there was nothing more I wanted from a neighborhood.

Their tragic, slow-motion falls — she to madness and a series of mental institutions, he to alcohol and an indifferent public — seemed inevitable, and drawn from the pages of one of his novels.

A classical scholar who came late to poetry, she rose, in the ’90s and ’00s, quickly and deservedly, to prominence. Many readers (including me) first knew her through “The Glass Essay,” a 38-page multipart lyric narrative in 1995’s “Glass, Irony and God.” The poem is an inspired mash-up: a confessional-style “I” recounts a breakup with a lover and a visit to an aged mother while considering the life and writings of Emily Brontë and reporting on her surrealist visions of nudes. The yoking of disparates, the old and the new, continues to be a Carson strategy. She’s generally claimed by the poetry world, but her books often contain swaths of lyric, critical or essayistic prose, as well as translation, dramatic dialogue and visual art. Many toil in the interstices of genre; Carson’s palatable, popular, sophisticated and who-cares approach may have done the most and best work in the last two decades to stop people worrying so much about what’s poetry and what’s not. At her best, she’s among our most exciting poets. At her less-than-best she’s reliably ingenious, full of charisma and surprise.

The highlight of the trip was a one-week tour of Myanmar, then almost completely cut off from the outside world. Three decades later, Jet Skiers and beach resorts have taken over my Thai island, and busloads of day-trippers flock to those Nepalese villages on a newly built trans-Himalayan highway.

What it does not feature, significantly, is any of the following: “Laundry hanging on a line. A little girl in a field of wildflowers. A pair of shoes on a beach. An empty swing on the porch of an old yellow house.” If that list sounds familiar, it’s because it appeared in the Book Review last year in Wolitzer’s essay “The Second Shelf,” about gender bias in publishing and the hurdles (including jacket art) facing any woman who hopes to be taken seriously as a literary novelist. Interviewing Wolitzer at Slate recently, her editor at Riverhead Books, Sarah McGrath, acknowledged treading carefully as a result: “We approached the art for this book with particular sensitivity,” she said, “and the art department was given a copy of your essay along with the manuscript.

Mr. Bendis is no stranger to team books.

In fact, the Avengers started to outshine the X-Men, who had previously been Marvel’s top franchise. “All New X-Men,” which collects the first five issues of the new series, is wonderfully entertaining. Time-travel stories are old hat, but Mr. Bendis manages to squeeze some delight out of this one. The original X-Men have traveled from the past to the present and are alarmed by what they see: one of them has betrayed their founder, Charles Xavier; one of them has evolved beyond recognition; another of them is dead. Though it may cause problems with the space-time continuum, the younger team opts to stay in the present, hoping to right some wrongs.

What I thought of almost immediately was an article that Elizabeth Rubin wrote for this magazine back in the summer of 2001, which I was lucky enough to edit. “Only You Can Save Your Sons” is an extraordinary feat of reporting and writing, as powerful and haunting as any magazine article I’ve ever read. It turned out that other editors here at the magazine were thinking about Elizabeth’s story, too, and as the discussion on Twitter and elsewhere throughout the day turned to questions of whether the Tsarnaev brothers were influenced by the Chechen war — and as the Chechen leader, Ramzan Kadyrov, announced that the root of the Tsarnaev’s “evil” lay in America and not in Chechnya — it seemed like a good idea to reach out to Elizabeth and get her thoughts, which follow below, on the Chechnya she experienced then and its connection, or lack of connection, to the men thought to have bombed the Boston Marathon.",Magazine,https://6thfloor.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/04/19/revisiting-chechnya/

But something more interesting evolved over the past several years as I returned to the Hungarian psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi’s work on “flow.” Coined in 1969, he defined flow as “the state in which people are so involved in an activity that nothing else seems to matter.” No surprise then that some of his first participants were composers: this is a constant aspiration. Composers have a reputation for working methods that include long sessions alone in their workplace with intense focus on their work, occasionally — indeed, arguably ideally — eventually losing a sense of time. I was attracted to this idea and felt a kinship, less to my working method but more in the way I thought and organized my music. But how was I to use “flow” in any musically meaningful way?",Opinion,https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/04/19/the-music-of-flow/

The agency proposed four options for regulating the waste from power plants, which are the top source of pollutants in streams, rivers and other waters. The final rules would have the most impact on coal-fired plants, which are the primary source of the pollutants, and would be phased in beginning in 2017. The Sierra Club, which sued the agency to issue the rules, said the announcement was an important step. “When finalized in their strongest form, the Environmental Protection Agency’s common-sense and affordable standards will save lives, prevent children from getting sick, and ensure our water is safe to drink and our fish safe to eat,” said Michael Brune, the group’s executive director.

2013-04-21,What’s on Sunday,Television highlights.,"10 P.M. (13, 49) THE BLETCHLEY CIRCLE Nine years after putting their extraordinary talents to use at Bletchley Park, Britain’s code-breaking headquarters during World War II, four seemingly ordinary women piece together clues they hope will solve a series of murders. Leading the charge is Susan (Anna Maxwell Martin, above), now a homemaker and mother of two, who wangles her way into Scotland Yard when she thinks she has detected a pattern to the killings. But when the police dismiss her theory, she turns for assistance to her former colleagues — Millie (Rachael Stirling), conversant in 14 languages and good with maps; Lucy (Sophie Rundle), with her photographic memory; and Jean (Julie Graham), their onetime supervisor — who, like Susan, have returned to civilian life and kept their intelligence work secret from even those closest to them. “While the solving of the mystery is fairly conventional, these amateur detectives aren’t,” Alessandra Stanley wrote in The New York Times. The three-part mystery “doesn’t have a preachy tone, but it does have a message, and it’s similar to the one in ‘Call the Midwife,’ “ the British series, leading in at 8, “that follows young nurses who after the war helped women in the poorest sections of London deliver babies, usually in tenement homes, on top of rags and newspapers,” she said, adding that “both series find a clever, entertaining way to pay tribute to women who in their time were often overlooked and underestimated, and nevertheless found ways to never be ordinary.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/21/arts/television/whats-on-sunday.html

(13) THE ISLAND PRESIDENT (2012) The director Jon Shenk visits the Maldives, an archipelago of about 1,200 low-lying islands in the Indian Ocean, and follows the efforts of Mohamed Nasheed, above, the country’s president from 2009 to 2012, as he tries to save the nation, a haven for wealthy tourists, from being swallowed by rising seas thought to be caused by global warming. “It is in the nature of political leaders, especially in democracies, to be optimistic, to insist that solutions can be found to even the most intractable problems,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. “Topical, politically engaged documentaries, particularly those made by American filmmakers, share in this tendency, offering implicit reassurance even as they deliver bad news about the state of the world.” Mr. Shenk’s film, presented here by “Independent Lens,” “is buoyant and spirited enough to keep those demons temporarily at bay,” Mr. Scott added. “It is impossible, while watching it, to root against Mr. Nasheed or to believe that he will fail. But the hope that infuses this movie makes it all the more upsetting to walk out of the theater and contemplate a looming disaster that the world’s leaders seem unable to prevent.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/22/arts/television/whats-on-monday.html

2013-04-22,Now Showing | ‘Artist/Rebel/Dandy: Men of Fashion’,A new exhibition at The Museum of Art Rhode Island School of Design capitalizes on the recent surge of interest in the artistry and craftsmanship of menswear.,"Peacocking, the preening of fastidiously dressed males of the fashion flock, has been exhaustively documented of late by international street fashion photographers who track willing prey in their natural habitats: outside fashion shows, fabulous parties and glitzy store openings where the rare birds tend to gather. The origin of this dandy species, Beau Brummel (1778-1840), and his fanciful progeny are the subject of the exhibition “Artist/Rebel/Dandy: Men of Fashion” at the Museum of Art Rhode Island School of Design, opening April 28. The curators, Kate Irvin and Laurie Brewer, from the school’s department of costume and textiles, have capitalized on this recent surge of interest in the artistry and craftsmanship of men’s wear with their study of clothing and ephemera honoring the aesthetic provocateur. Aided by an archive that includes the personal wardrobe of Richard Merkin, a legendary RISD professor, painter and dandy-in-residence, the curators constructed a thematic, rather than chronological, exploration into what they term the “always provocative dandy stance.” Delving deeper than the decorative surface, they contrast the social subversion of dandy “revolutionaries,” who express political views through their personal wardrobes, with a dandy “historian’s” appreciation of tailoring tradition, while a “connoisseur” prides self-expression over societal conformity. Thom Browne says in the accompanying catalog’s preface that “Rebellion comes from being perfectly comfortable doing my own thing and having the drive to make challenging statements in men’s wear.” According to the curators, by “kicking at the boundaries of taste,” the dandy is indeed much more than the commonly criticized “superficial person devoted only to the outer shell.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/04/22/now-showing-artistrebeldandy-men-of-fashion/

Actually, it was ridiculous after you witnessed it too, but that was the point. The reason it worked, among other things, was that their songs were surprisingly great, and the band could fill a room with an energy that inspired villainy. The altercation I wrote about at a 1996 show at Brownie’s in the East Village was apparently not uncommon. “We had a lot of extremes, people who loved the humor, and then a lot of people who got out of control,” Widmer says. “It seemed to make people go crazy.

Wei disassembled and photographed 20 varieties of flowers, arranging each blossom’s pieces to emphasize its radial symmetry. It’s a graphic and colorful way of looking at one of nature’s most recognizable symbols of spring. Wei started the series in 2011 and finished last November; the images have been making the rounds on various design blogs recently because five of the pictures won second place as a series in the 2012 International Photography Awards.

2013-04-24,What’s On Wednesday,Television highlights.,"5:35 P.M. (Starz) THE IDES OF MARCH (2011) George Clooney, Grant Heslov and Beau Willimon received an Oscar nomination for best adapted screenplay for this political drama, which Mr. Clooney, above, also directed and stars in as Mike Morris, a Pennsylvania governor turned dream candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination. Ryan Gosling plays Stephen Meyers, a strategist who becomes involved with an intern (Evan Rachel Wood) with a powerful father and a secret that could derail Stephen’s career and the Morris campaign. Philip Seymour Hoffman and Paul Giamatti are senior advisers battling for Stephen’s loyalty. And Marisa Tomei is a reporter trying to get at the truth. “Mr. Clooney handles the plot complications with elegant dexterity,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times about this adaptation of Mr. Willimon’s play “Farragut North,” loosely based on Howard Dean’s 2004 Democratic presidential primary campaign. “As an actor he works best in long, understated scenes that allow him to play with nuances of charm and menace, so it is not surprising that, as a director, he gives the rest of the cast room to work,” Mr. Scott added. “But the parts of ‘The Ides of March’ — quiet scenes between Mr. Gosling and Ms. Wood; swirling, Sorkinesque exchanges of banter; any time Ms. Tomei or Max Minghella (as a campaign worker grooming himself to be the next Stephen Meyers) are in the room — are greater than the whole.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/24/arts/television/whats-on-wednesday.html

Rather than welded, these two pieces are screwed together, which produces a visually light effect and reveals that the frame is solid metal, rather than plated. “You can go anywhere and find a plated table,” said David Khouri, a partner in the firm. “I want people to think about how this one’s made.” A standard-size table is 22.5 inches high and 19.5 inches wide.

2013-04-25,Where’s the Baby?,Jennifer Gilmore’s novel centers on the complexities of adoption.,"In 1991, Kathryn Harrison published “Thicker Than Water,” a novel about a young woman struggling to come to terms with the sexual relationship she’d had with her father. Three books later, she published “The Kiss,” a memoir in which she examined, in excruciating detail, the sexual relationship she’d had with her father. In reading both of these impressive books, the line between novel and memoir unavoidably blurs. More recently, the gifted Canadian author Sheila Heti wrote “How Should a Person Be” — “a novel,” as its subtitle proclaims, “from life.” Sheila is the protagonist, surrounded by friends with the same names and occupations as those in her life off the page. This is a relatively extreme case in autobiographical fiction, more experimental than confessional, in which the niceties of inventing characters are dispensed with entirely. It’s an intriguing and sometimes unsettling decision, resulting in a sort of hybrid: not quite fiction, not quite memoir. Sitcoms have used this device for years, with stars from Ozzie and Harriet Nelson to Louis C. K. creating irreverent alternative realities modeled closely on their lives.

The trial, known as HVTN 505, started in 2009 with 2,504 gay male volunteers in 19 cities who got three shots over eight weeks. A recent analysis by an outside monitoring board found that more volunteers who got the vaccine became infected during a follow-up period than volunteers who got a placebo. However, the numbers of men infected — 27 vaccine recipients versus 21 placebo recipients — were statistically too close to say that the test vaccine had actually increased the chances of infection, according to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which sponsored the trial. Those who got the vaccine and became infected anyway also did not have less virus in their blood, the monitoring board found. The vaccine was based on an adenovirus, which causes common colds. In 2007, another trial of an adenovirus-based vaccine was halted because it was not working, and later analysis suggested that for some men — those who had previously caught adenovirus colds — the vaccine made it more likely, rather than less, that they would get infected with H.I.V.

He has not been idle. Still, any or all of those books, excellent as they are, might suggest a career in twilight, with grand gestures and major lifts all in the rearview mirror. And why not?

It’s an irresistible, high-octane mix — and a departure from the steamier pleasures of her critically acclaimed first novel, “Telex From Cuba.” The language is equally gorgeous, however, and Kushner’s insights into place, society and the complicated rules of belonging, and unbelonging, can be mordantly brilliant. None of the characters in “The Flamethrowers” are quite what they seem, fabricating pasts as nonchalantly as they throw together their art. Above all, they hunger to be seen, to distinguish themselves from the ordinary. One artist, responding to the question of why he invents, defends his florid lies as “a form of discretion.” ",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/28/books/review/rachel-kushners-flamethrowers.html

Capp (1909-79), whose comic strip “Li’l Abner” ran for 43 years and reached 90 million readers at its peak, was a celebrity: a radio personality, magazine essayist, talk-show regular and college speaker. Among his strip’s contributions to the cultural landscape were the expression “double whammy” and the invention of Sadie Hawkins Day, a mock holiday (and national craze in its time) that inspired Sadie Hawkins dances, to which women could invite men. Underlying Capp’s antic humor and prodigious productivity, however, was a toxic chip on his shoulder.

(Sundance) A RIVER RUNS THROUGH IT (1992) Craig Sheffer portrays the writer Norman Maclean as a quiet, scholarly young man, and Brad Pitt (above right, with Mr. Sheffer) is Paul, his wilder, more magnetic brother, in this adaptation of Mr. Maclean’s 1976 autobiographical story about the sons of a Presbyterian minister (Tom Skerritt) coming of age in western Montana between Prohibition and the Great Depression — and finding expression for their emotions through fly-fishing. “These are men for whom the physical is inseparably entwined with the spiritual, men for whom both aspects of life are best appreciated knee-deep in a rushing river on a glorious day,” Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times. “Between the novella’s well-known first sentence (‘In our family, there was no clear line between religion and fly-fishing’) and its elegiac last line (‘I am haunted by waters’), ‘A River Runs Through It’ circled gracefully among the landmarks of Mr. Maclean’s early years without violating the distant perfection of those memories.” She added: “It’s easy to recognize Robert Redford’s reverent film version of this beautifully spare novella as a labor of love. While the film is more lavish than Mr. Maclean’s story, and hence less commandingly precise, it radiates much the same seriousness of purpose. The same thoughts embraced by Mr. Maclean — of family and history, of the unbridgeable distances between men, of a wild natural landscape as a pathway to spiritual grace — are ably reflected on the screen.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/27/arts/television/whats-on-saturday.html

According to the National Crime Records Bureau between 2001 and 2011 there has been a three-fold increase in registered cases of child sex abuse, from 2,113 in 2001 to 7,112 a decade later. In speaking with experts in the field and those who deal with victims and perpetrators of child sex abuse, the authors find that it is not easy to determine a direct cause for the increase in sex abuse among minors. They find that offenders vary in behavior and psychology and therefore it is both hard to draw any generalizations and create effective means of prevention.",World,https://india.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/04/28/newswallah-long-reads-edition-60/

She sang them with the full range of her voice, making them twice as good, with a kind of severe passion, only semi-sentimental, following their unsettling, unresolving melodic trajectories. They were somewhere between rudimentary and very achieved: new lieder, or some radically decelerated soul-jazz hybrid, or melted torch numbers.

2013-04-28,NBC Renews 5 Dramas,"NBC really does have a batch of shows that are working, despite a rough patch this spring that even induced a presidential-level joke on Saturday night.","NBC really does have a batch of shows that are working, despite a rough patch this spring that even induced a presidential-level joke on Saturday night. Last week NBC announced it was renewing five drama series, including two, “Revolution” and “Chicago Fire,” that the network introduced this season. “Grimm,” arguably the network’s most reliable drama, was another show that was renewed; it holds up Friday night for the network and has experienced a ratings increase of 14 percent this season. The ratings for “Law & Order Special Victims Unit” have descended to just about survival level, but that show will return in a move that has been a ritual for the network for 15 years. “Parenthood,” the well-regarded family drama that performed well this year (up 8 percent), had been truncated to only 15 episodes, a sign that the network did not have the most faith in its endurance before this season started. That was also a sign that cost was a factor in considering its fate: “Parenthood” has a big budget and an enormous cast, with several star-name actors, including Lauren Graham, Peter Krause and Dax Shepard. A renewal order had been in some doubt until last week because of those budget concerns, but NBC announced that “Parenthood” would be back and with a full order of 22 episodes. The NBC announcement didn’t stop President Obama from taking a little shot at the network’s prime-time woes at the White House Correspondents’ Dinner on Saturday night. Joking about his recent performance at a basketball demonstration, the president said: “I took 22 shots and made 2 of them. That’s right, 2 hits and 20 misses.

That’s the rational choice, yet what I want most is gamay, the grape of Beaujolais. Why?

For me, this combination was comfort and beauty. Nowadays, I might choose a gamay from the Loire Valley, or one of the few American versions, like Edmunds St. John’s, which I think come closer to those lighthearted yet compelling wines.
