2015-12-01,"‘Map: Exploring the World,’ ‘The Curious Map Book’ and More",Several new books explore the power of spatial representations and how they shape our perceptions of reality.,"What is it about maps that we find so fascinating? Ever since the Babylonians scratched two parallel lines and a circle — representing the Euphrates River and their walled capital — on a clay tablet almost 3,000 years ago, we humans have been producing flat spatial imagery to locate our place in the world. Maps anchor us, give coherence to our environment, help make visual sense of otherwise intangible realities. The most skillfully done maps, moreover, can be thrilling to look at, elevating cartography into art. Renaissance mapmakers filled the borders of their works with beautifully rendered dragons and wind-puffing gods; the modernist painter Jasper Johns playfully reimagined the standard road-atlas depiction of the continental United States in his 1961 work “Map.” Maps can solidify national identity, expose societal problems, illuminate trends and whip up jingoistic emotions in wartime. “The map as a concept is complex and ever changing,” the Library of Congress cartography expert John Hessler writes in his introduction to “Map: Exploring the World.” But “it is the cartographic image’s intricate and abstract visual element that is the locus of its strength and lasting appeal.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/06/books/review/map-exploring-the-world-the-curious-map-book-and-more.html

And no matter what we think of it today, it has been forever since Hollywood was all it’s cracked up to be. As Marlene ­Dietrich once wrote, “When I came to Hollywood, the great era of silent films was over and done with. The village was not ‘gay and reckless’ anymore. The studios operated like any other establishment — one had to clock in at a certain hour and heaven help you if you failed to do so.

He cuts an odd figure as portraitist of the Harlem Renaissance and its successors. He was a culture vulture and party-giver who liked to be in on the latest thing, and maybe his friendships with African-­American artists and intellectuals represented nothing more than a kind of cultural tourism. Certainly W.E.B. Du Bois mistrusted him, and Ralph Ellison “despised his photography,” and he alienated many with his sensational 1926 roman à clef, “Nigger Heaven.” But he got Langston Hughes published, and furthered the careers of others; Walter White, head of the N.A.A.C.P., named his son Carl.

At the same time, a steady stream of dancers, musicians and stage handlers flowed in for a different kind of spectacle — the first rehearsal of the artist Ryan McNamara and the musician Devonté Hynes’s collaborative, one-night-only performance, “Dimensions.” Commissioned by PAMM as part of its annual multimedia series, which partners artists with musicians, “Dimensions” has been in the works since the last Art Basel Miami Beach — but with three days until showtime, last night was the first time the full cast had been assembled. “I hadn’t even seen the stages until today,” laughed McNamara, who stole the show at last year’s fair with “ME3M,” his hybrid, Internet-themed ballet at Miami’s Grand Theater. “I think Dev said it best when he described it as a two-hour dance/soul/opera experience.”",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/01/t-magazine/art-basel-miami-ryan-mcnamara-dev-hynes.html

Residents reduced their water used in October by 22.2 percent compared with 2013, the state’s lowest conservation rate since mandatory water reductions began in the summer. Over all, residents remain on a pace to meet the 25 percent goal, having saved 27.1 percent over 2013 in the five months from June to October. State water officials have said saving water will be more difficult during the winter because Californians used less water during the winter in years past. They said they expected conservation rates to remain lower during the colder months. “I was relieved at the numbers,” Felicia Marcus, chairwoman of the State Water Resources Control Board, said of October’s 22 percent figure. The emergency drought regulations will be in effect through February, but officials are considering a new set of emergency regulations if the drought continues.

I know I don’t require even one more traditional recipe for summer rolls, chicken curry or mushroom risotto. As Dale Talde writes in ASIAN-AMERICAN: Proudly Inauthentic Recipes From the Philippines to Brooklyn (Grand Central Life & Style, $32), we “used to want food to be a pat on the back, not an uppercut to the chin.” Today, the best recipes communicate a rebellious spirit and a back story amounting to more than a fill-in-the-blank: “I went to X and fell in love with Y.” Whether it’s Thailand and green papaya salad, Israel and lemon-mint couscous, or France and sole meunière (if you’re Julia Child), these stories have grown tiresome if not precious. I gravitate toward lawless recipes that fall under the admittedly loose rubric of what Talde calls an “immigrant’s cuisine.” This is food undergirded by a strong tradition of regional home cooking overlain by the potent influence of “diners, gyro shops, Polish delis, taquerias, burger joints, Chinese spots and other food meccas.” This food is defined as much by “meat loaf and hot dogs” as it is by “shawarma and roti, tacos and yakitori.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/06/books/review/cooking-asian-american-women-chefs-of-new-york-and-more.html

In “The Jemima Code,” her inspiring account of the stories of our unsung and unrewarded history, Toni Tipton-Martin has made such a claim and has served up a slice of history with bold flavors, cultural enlightenment and real-life images of the people of color whose culinary contributions are realized in these pages.

Murray Abraham in “Gallileo”). So it’s fitting that one of his last productions at the intimate gem of a theater pairs Tonya Pinkins with one of the mightiest roles in the canon, the title character in Brecht’s “Mother Courage and Her Children.” In playing the canny survivor ground down by a war-torn world, Ms. Pinkins will be following the likes of Fiona Shaw and Meryl Streep. Ms. Pinkins often seems to elevate her material, but when she sinks into a complex role worthy of her gifts — “Caroline, or Change” is perhaps the best example — the results can be thrilling.

2015-12-02,Intimate Pictures From a Legendary Photographer,"Peter Schlesinger — who captured Swinging London at its golden peak — on his new book, old friends and domestic pleasures.","“Hardly anyone keeps albums anymore,’’ says the photographer Peter Schlesinger as we flip through stacks of embossed picture diaries in his New York loft. ‘‘But I guess no one really did then either.’’ The perfectly preserved, chronologically organized volumes begin soon after 1966, the year the California-born Schlesinger, then 18, met the British painter David Hockney, who was teaching a summer course at U.C.L.A. This was the beginning of a love affair that would take Schlesinger to London, straight into the eye of a twister of bohemian glamour and creativity. While studying painting at the Slade School of Fine Art, he began to capture the most magnetic personalities in the couple’s social circle with his Pentax camera. There was the fashion designer Ossie Clark and his partner Celia Birtwell, the model Amanda Lear, Manolo Blahnik, Paloma Picasso, Cecil Beaton and the man who would eventually become Schlesinger’s lifelong partner, the Swedish-born photographer Eric Boman. With a natural, snapshot-like aesthetic, Schlesinger managed to conjure happy, blink-and-they’re-gone moments in time. There were weekend trips to Beaton’s country house, wine-drenched lunches by the pool at Tony Richardson’s in the South of France and late-night dancing at everyone’s favorite underground club in London, Yours or Mine. These effervescent images became the basis of his first book: ‘‘Checkered Past,’’ published in 2003. Schlesinger recently released a second volume, ‘‘Peter Schlesinger: A Photographic Memory 1968-1989’’ ($50, Damiani), which includes some of his greatest (and formerly unseen) hits from the London years plus images from his life after he and Boman moved to Manhattan 37 years ago. Schlesinger, now a ceramic artist, has lived and worked with Boman in the same former girdle factory in the Flatiron district for these past decades. Four months a year they decamp to their house in Bellport, N.Y., where Boman bakes and Schlesinger tends the garden. ‘‘These days I take more pictures of my plants than anything else,’’ he says. ‘‘But they’re my friends, too.’’",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/01/t-magazine/peter-schlesinger-photography-book.html

The 1916 movie “Sherlock Holmes” (newly restored and released by Flicker Alley in a dual Blu-ray/DVD edition) grounds that character’s virtual reality in a corporeal presence, namely that of the tall, craggy American actor William Gillette (1853-1937).",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/06/movies/homevideo/shaken-stirred-and-elementary-sherlock-holmes-and-thunderball.html

These tales — pocket epics of romantic, creative and social frustration set in recognizably drab, drably picturesque American landscapes — certainly invite comparison to the work of words-only short-form masters like Raymond ­Carver, Ann Beattie and Mary Gaitskill, and for that matter O.

In 1955, a photographer for Magnum, Dennis Stock, shadowed and snapped an ascendant James Dean for Life magazine, a few months before Dean died in a car accident. Mr. Corbijn picturesquely frames the back story to the shoot, but his muffled retelling drifts with Dane DeHaan’s murmurous impersonation of Dean and Robert Pattinson’s almost perversely listless turn as Stock.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/04/movies/review-in-life-photographing-james-dean-the-rising-star.html

Hugh Fraser and, later, wife of the playwright Harold Pinter — made the startling discovery that she was “not really a girl.” That is, having just spent four years learning Greek and Latin at a school for boys (mostly) called the Dragon, next door to her family’s home in Oxford, England, she excelled at ancient languages and at the knock-’em-sock-’em sport of rugby, but was completely unschooled in conventional girlish behavior.

In “First Bite: How We Learn to Eat,” she traces this instinct to a ritual she had with her father when she was a teenager. Her parents had just split up, and whenever her dad would send Wilson on a train back to her mother’s house, he’d buy her a magazine and a box of chocolate-coated malted milk balls, something that, before her parents’ divorce, would have been deemed a special-occasion treat. She felt powerless to refuse the candy, even as she was struggling with a disconcerting weight gain. It took Wilson years to realize that her father’s gesture was as much about making him feel like “the generous provider” as it was to reward her with a happy sugar high. She writes: “To give a child the things she loves to eat bestows a heroic glow. It feels almost as wonderful as eating.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/06/books/review/bee-wilsons-first-bite-how-we-learn-to-eat.html

It’s poignant how dazed New Order looks in this video — a couple of years earlier, they were your basic mopey indie twits, and here they are making the scene as their music plays at the world’s hippest dance club. Yet the most poignant sight is that of the singer Bernard Sumner, who spends the first half of the clip wearing deck shorts and white tube socks.

The population, amounting to 183,000, reached this morning to 400,000 by the influx of foreign Princes and their suites, crowds of Belgians, Germans, Luxemburgers and Dutch provincials; 25,000 visitors came from Amsterdam alone, and many spent the night in the streets, finding no lodgings. Many of the streets were decked with tricolor flags, and the balconies and windows were decorated with black hangings. Wooden stands for sightseers were erected in all the streets, in the shop fronts and even on the decks of the barges on the canals, and places were paid for at extraordinary prices. An Englishman gave 300 florins for a window. The procession formed, one mile long, and taking seventy-five minutes to pass a given point, the principal features were the muffled drums, the military bands playing Chopin’s and Handel’s funeral dirges. — The New York Herald, European Edition, December 5, 1890",World,https://iht-retrospective.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/12/04/1890-king-william-laid-in-his-grave/

Patterson was at the National Book Awards ceremony last month, at Cipriani Wall Street, to accept the Literarian Award for his efforts to promote reading. “I feel uncomfortable,” he told the crowd, “because, well, I am the elephant in the room, the bull in the china shop, the stranger in a strange land, the Big Mac at Cipriani.” He went on to discuss his early love of fiction — he’s partial to the terrific novels “Mr. Bridge” and “Mrs. Bridge,” by Evan S. Connell — and to praise school libraries and independent bookstores, encouraging his listeners to help those institutions if they could: “Let’s all be literarians, whatever the hell that means.” He also revealed that his debut mystery, “The Thomas Berryman Number,” had been rejected 31 times before finding a home. “I keep a list of all the editors who turned down my first novel,” he said. “Sometimes they send me books and ask for blurbs. Mostly, though, they’re dead.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/13/books/review/inside-the-list.html

2015-12-04,"In Miami, a Trio of Minimalist Paintings","Though figurative art is having a moment, a few galleries bucked the trend and showed spare, monochromatic paintings instead.","It’s undeniable that figuration stands tall in today’s art market — bodies of all shapes and sizes are in evidence throughout the Miami art fairs and are the subject of one of the most buzzed-about pop-up exhibitions in town, “Unrealism,” at the Design District’s Moore Building, curated by the heavyweight double bill of Jeffrey Deitch and Larry Gagosian. However, as soon as a trend hits a saturation point, the window opens wide for a counterpoint. Throughout Art Basel Miami Beach, there are a number of strikingly spare paintings whose minimal, monochromatic brushstrokes bear uncanny superficial resemblances, despite originating from very different times and places. The 78-year-old Swiss painter Niele Toroni is known for applying short, squarish acrylic streaks of a prescribed size in strict patterns; he has new works on offer at a number of booths, including Alfonso Artiaco. On offer at Greene Naftali is a historical work by the recently deceased German painter Gunther Forg — who, though prolific like Toroni, is known for constant variation rather than repetition. Finally, the Paris-based South Korean artist Lee Ufan’s canvas of two blocky gray smears at Galerie Nächst St. Stephan Rosemarie Schwarzwälder is discreetly rooted in the natural origin of its materials, which combine oil with pigments of stone.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/04/t-magazine/art/art-basel-miami-monochromatic-paintings.html

A Turkish army is being concentrated in the region of Phillipopolis, in fulfilment of Turco-Bulgarian agreements. This army is stated to number 75,000 men. Its organization, however, is slow, and its intervention cannot be regarded as imminent. Guns of 305mm. and 210mm., sent from Germany, are reported to have arrived in the Gallipoli Peninsula, where the Turks are preparing for an offensive soon. It is asserted among German officers in Constantinople that the expedition against Egypt will set out about the beginning of next month. The Turks, evidently a prey to megalomania, state that by the spring they will have an army of two million men. — The New York Herald, European Edition, December 7, 1915",World,https://iht-retrospective.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/12/06/1915-turkish-army-prepares-for-offensive/

Theoretically the notion of a supreme deity was officially recognized by the charter of the French educational system as laid down by Jules Ferry, founder of the modern French public-school system, but in practice it had been ignored by the great majority of French school teachers for years. But now, by a law just promulgated, Georges Ripert, Minister of Education, has decreed that ‘‘programs of morality must henceforth be taught in the elementary and secondary schools’’ beginning Jan. 1, 1941. In the elementary schools one hour a week must be devoted to the following subject: ‘‘The principal duties of the pupils toward their neighbors (family and country) and toward God.’’ — New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, December 7, 1940",World,https://iht-retrospective.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/12/06/1940-vichy-schools-again-to-teach-concept-of-god/

2015-12-07,Marilynne Robinson’s ‘The Givenness of Things’,Marilynne Robinson looks at America’s Christian beliefs in the Age of Information.,"A sense of wonder pervades the powerful essays in “The Givenness of Things,” Marilynne Robinson’s new collection. “Existence is remarkable, actually incredible,” Robinson exclaims; even materiality is “profoundly amazing, uncanny.” Yet unlike physics, which has a strong sense of the “givenness” Robinson refers to in her title, neo-Darwinian positivism rejects anything — the self, the soul or God — that cannot be explained empirically. Robinson defines the “given” as something “that presents itself, reveals itself, always partially and circumstantially, accessible to only tentative apprehension, which means that it is always newly meaningful.” Calvin insisted that divine wisdom was one such “given,” perceived only “within radical limits.” Robinson does not say so, but here Calvin was deeply in tune with the great sages of the past, who all maintained that the transcendence we call God, Brahman, Nirvana or Dao must always ultimately elude us.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/13/books/review/marilynne-robinsons-the-givenness-of-things.html

But her new fairy tale of a novel, “The Japanese Lover,” doesn’t allow love to get in the way of comfort. As in all of Allende’s fiction, we find a large, colorful cast of characters, this time swirling around the octogenarian Alma Belasco, happily if peculiarly ensconced in Lark House, a retirement home in San Francisco. Foremost is Irina Bazili, the young Moldovan immigrant whose repressed “terrors” of adolescence form a drumbeat of foreshadowing through the three years of her service to Alma. But as the story lurches back to the late 1930s and then to the highlights between, we also meet Alma’s Jewish family in pre-World War II Europe; the San Francisco relatives who adopt her; the entire family of her Japanese lover, Ichimei Fukuda; and a host of other lovers, care givers, evildoers and saints. No character is so minor as to lack a back story. At the same time, no character, including Alma and Irina, manages to fill in his or her outlines and command our undivided attention.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/13/books/review/the-japanese-lover-by-isabel-allende.html

2015-12-10,Report Traces Ebola’s Spread in Liberia,The height of the epidemic in Liberia can be traced back to a single case of the disease probably introduced from Sierra Leone.," Ebola viruses that sickened many people during the height of the epidemic in Liberia can be traced back to a single case of the disease probably introduced from Sierra Leone, according to a report published Wednesday in the journal Cell Host and Microbe. “The data are consistent with the vast majority of cases in Liberia coming from a single event,” said Jason T. Ladner of the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute for Infectious Diseases. The virus then spread from Liberia back into Guinea, where the current epidemic was first identified.

With her “Honesty Pictures” series, the artist Alice Cazenave aims to find out, by capturing the delicate inner workings of leaves and stems. Inspired by her background in molecular science as well as her family history of craftspeople (her relatives have included cabinetmakers and draftswomen), Cazenave employs experimental, camera-free techniques to get at the essence of plants. She strips the leaves of pigment by washing them in chemical solutions that transform them into translucent, glassy structures, then uses them directly as negatives, placing them onto photosensitive paper and then exposing them to light. She doesn’t use lenses or screens, in an effort to create images as a “direct consequence of an interaction between light and object,” she says. This series is intended to capture a sense of “shadows peeled off the real” — and to restore a sense of wonder and mystery to a medium that has become almost universally accessible. “Much of my work comments on the growing disengagement with the natural world, and aims to re-establish a sense of magic and alchemy to photography, which I feel in recent times has been lost.”",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/10/t-magazine/art/plant-photography-alice-cazenave.html

2015-12-11,1915: A Funereal Error,From the International Herald Tribune archives: A widow receives the wrong coffin in 1915.,"BERLIN — A widow lady named Wachterhausen, residing at Potsdam, recently had the misfortune to lose her only daughter, Amalia, who was staying at Nice for the benefit of her health. The mother telegraphed to an undertaker in that town ordering an elaborate coffin, and requesting that the remains should be sent home for burial. Just before the funeral on Sunday the mother had the coffin opened, and found that it contained, not her child, but the body of an old officer in Russian uniform. On making inquiries she learned by telegram from Nice that the bodies had been accidentally exchanged. Her daughter’s body had been forwarded to Smolensk in Russia instead of that of the officer. On telegraphing to the Russian authorities Madame Wachterhausen was informed that the body of her daughter had just been buried with great ceremony and military honors. — The New York Herald, European Edition, December 12, 1915",World,https://iht-retrospective.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/12/11/1915-a-funereal-error/

Briggle had never even heard of fracking when he was hired as a professor of philosophy at the University of North Texas, in 2009. But with around 250 gas wells drilled within Denton’s city limits, the subject was thrust upon his consciousness. A member of the City Council asked him to form a citizens’ advisory group for gas-well regulations, and Briggle became a field philosopher, running across highways, helping collect air samples from backyards, consulting not only Mary Shelley and the theologian Duns Scotus to help guide him along “the arduous trail that is thinking” but also scientists, engineers, mayors, neighbors and his daughter, Lulu, a 2-year-old rogue impervious to propaganda.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/13/books/review/a-field-philosophers-guide-to-fracking-by-adam-briggle.html

2015-12-11,Inside the List,"Desmond Tutu, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1984 for his opposition to South African apartheid, has a best seller with “The Book of Forgiving,” written with his daughter Mpho Tutu.","Let It Go: Desmond Tutu, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1984 for his opposition to South African apartheid, turns up on the monthly relationships list on Page 24 this week: “The Book of Forgiving,” written with his daughter Mpho Tutu, is at No. 9. “It doesn’t matter whether you are having trouble moving forward from the wrongs that were done to you, or whether you need the courage to admit the wrongs you have done,” he writes in the introduction. “Forgiveness is nothing less than the way we heal the world. We heal the world by healing each and every one of our hearts.” If that kind of talk triggers flashbacks to your last cardiologist visit — the best way to heal our hearts is probably to eat less bacon — it remains true that Tutu writes with undeniable moral force. And given his experiences leading the Truth and Reconciliation Commission after apartheid’s fall, his prescription is not just simple but consistent and radical. “In South Africa, we chose to seek forgiveness rather than revenge,” he writes. “That choice averted a blood bath. For every injustice, there is a choice. . . . You can choose forgiveness or revenge, but revenge is always costly. Choosing forgiveness rather than retaliation ultimately serves to make you a stronger and freer person.” As it happens, your cardiologist might agree. According to the Johns Hopkins Medicine website, “Studies have found that the act of forgiveness can reap huge rewards for your health, lowering the risk of heart attack; improving cholesterol levels and sleep; and reducing pain, blood pressure and levels of anxiety, depression and stress.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/20/books/review/inside-the-list.html

The underlying principle isn’t much more than the logic of the marketplace — the search for the new commodity, explicitly applied to literature. But these lists are haunted by a cluster of unspoken questions about writing’s relationship to longevity. Are writers so short of material that they need to be anointed before midlife? Is novelistic craft not perfected over time? If the answers to these questions aren’t obvious, why not imagine a shadow list that gathers the best American fiction by writers over 80? William H. Gass — 91 years old at the time of writing — would certainly benefit from such a list, since his work typically gestates across decades. He labored on his central achievement, “The Tunnel” (1995), for longer than some acclaimed young novelists have been alive, while his latest volume, “Eyes,” has similarly been in the pipeline at least since the turn of the millennium.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/13/books/review/william-h-gasss-eyes-and-john-barths-collected-stories.html

Named Hualianceratops wucaiwanensis, the plant-eater stood on its hind legs and was about the size of a spaniel.

There were dozens of species of ceratopsians, but Triceratops, which lived in North America about 65 million years ago, is the best known. “These small dinosaurs were related to Triceratops, but very distantly,” said Catherine A. Forster, a paleontologist at George Washington University and one of the team who discovered Hualianceratops.

According to the statement of Yankton Charlie, the Sioux Government scout, each chief claimed the leadership and tried to secure it forcibly. From twenty-five to fifty Indians were killed in the struggle. This report is confirmed by friendly Indians who escaped to the Agency during the fight. The depredations of the Indians now extend to the foot of the Black Hills. It is thought to be useless to talk of peace at present. There has been no attempt by the hostile Indians to move out of their entrenchments since the peace council was held. Official despatches received at Washington state that the situation in the Indian territories is favorable, and that the display of troops has demoralized the hostile Indians. — The New York Herald, European Edition, December 14, 1890",World,https://iht-retrospective.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/12/13/1890-reported-battle-between-indians/

Nearly square, it evokes an earlier era, when all movies looked this way, and also emphasizes the claustrophobia of the story and the setting. We are in a Nazi death camp, and really in it, to a degree that few fictional films have had the nerve to attempt. The camera doesn’t just survey the barracks and the guard towers, the haggard prisoners and brutal guards. It takes us to the very door of the gas chambers, in the close company of Saul Auslander (Geza Rohrig), a Jewish inmate who is a member of the camp’s Sonderkommando (special commando) unit.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/18/movies/review-son-of-saul-revisits-life-and-death-in-auschwitz.html

2015-12-18,United Nations: Sanctions Against ISIS Adopted,The Security Council adopted a resolution aimed at preventing banned terrorist groups from making money and using the international banking system.," The United Nations Security Council on Thursday unanimously adopted a legally binding resolution aimed at preventing banned terrorist groups from making money and using the international banking system, with an emphasis on the Islamic State group. The resolution builds on previous Council measures, also legally binding, that make it illegal to donate money to terrorist groups, trade in oil and antiquities or make ransom payments. Those prohibitions are sometimes ignored, and the new resolution, drafted by Russia and the United States, is intended to strengthen it. The resolution calls on countries to describe what steps they are taking to prevent terrorist organizations from making money, including interdicting oil sales. The effects may be limited: The Islamic State group draws a large share of its revenues from “taxes” imposed on the people who live in its territories. Perhaps the most incongruous element of the resolution is that one of its sponsors is the government of Syria.

2015-12-18,Inside the List,Claudia Rankine’s hard-to-classify “Citizen” stayed on the monthly race and civil rights best-seller list all year.,"Indefinable: Poetry doesn’t hit the lists very often, but when it does, it can hit big. In 2015, Claudia Rankine’s “Citizen” stayed on the monthly race and civil rights list all year; it’s currently No. 5. A hard-to-classify volume of prose poems, or lyrical essays, about daily encounters with racism — “I wanted to replicate the sense of having these stories come at you,” Rankine told The New Statesman — the book has also spent time on the paperback nonfiction list and, more counterintuitively, the monthly relationships list. (One place it hasn’t appeared yet is the monthly politics list, although that may change now that a young woman in Illinois was spotted reading it at a Trump rally.) The people who compile the Times lists aren’t the only ones who have struggled to define Rankine’s book. Last winter, “Citizen” became the first title ever nominated for a National Book Critics Circle Award in two categories: A finalist in criticism, it won in poetry. So what is this book, exactly? And how does Rankine feel about efforts to pin it down? “If we leave the structural hybridity of ‘Citizen’ aside,” she told me via email, “I want to believe there is a recognized veracity of experience for the people categorizing the book. Each feels ‘Citizen’ satisfies some truth or intention for their category. I am a poet, and I didn’t fictionalize the accounts told to me or taken from my life or from the news; I simply submerged my thinking into the ‘ethical loneliness’ (a phrase taken from the title of Jill Stauffer’s excellent book) that the sentences accumulated. The lyrical reflection of lives struggling to negotiate racism in our culture apparently feels authentic to many categories. That seems right.” Then she quoted a line from “Sentences and Paragraphs,” by Gertrude Stein: “Never ask any one what a sentence is or what it has been.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/27/books/review/inside-the-list.html

Milan, Spokane, London, Washington, Tulsa, Tuscaloosa, Cleveland, Des Moines, Chicago, Charlottesville: He’s crossed the deserts bare, man, he’s breathed the mountain air, he’s been everywhere. Morse is a motivational speaker, which accounts for his traveling, but he also moonlights as a reviewer for a website called RateYourLodging.com, which accounts for the way this novel is constructed: as a series of 37 hotel reviews. (One way we know we’re in a fictional ­universe: Morse suggests he is paid for posting his opinions online.) The hotels under review range from the Plaza in New York City (Morse, as a child, spent a night there in the early 1970s) to a Radisson in Waterbury, Conn. (an ideal place, he notes, for those “in search of the loneliest night imaginable”), to the Capri Whitestone in the Bronx, with “its view of the Whitestone Bridge toll plaza” and “the overpowering reverberation of death” in its communal bathroom.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/20/books/review/rick-moodys-hotels-of-north-america.html

High grades, high test scores and admission to one of the nation’s elite colleges have long been embraced as symbols of excellence and, by extension, successful parenting. Abeles suggests that pursuit of this narrow form of success is actually harming children and families, and distorting our educational institutions. Her book is bound to be controversial, particularly to the education establishment — university presidents, the testing industry and the policy makers who support them. For many of them, “Beyond Measure” is likely to be regarded as a threat, if not downright subversive.

2015-12-18,"‘The Art of Grace,’ by Sarah L. Kaufman",An author and dance critic would like us to reclaim a lost virtue.,"“The Art of Grace” . . . “The Art of Grace.” It is concerning when the title of a book has a wannabe whiff. Or is it just graceless me that smells it? But the alternative, in this case, is worse, and it is as precious and highfalutin as it sounds given that the author is not Thomas Aquinas or John Ruskin. It is a phrase that promotes its author as an arbiter of grace, a lofty perch indeed from which to view us mere clumsy mortals. And so, Sarah L. Kaufman, in her first book, sets the stakes perilously high, particularly since her subject is not exactly origami but grace, that fragile, exquisite, transient entity of unparalleled depth, breadth, complexity and profundity. She has taken on, perhaps to her credit, the Sisyphean task of persuading us to choose grace over ego and so revisits that epic battle where grace loses every time — though ego never wins. Such ambition! But why not? We are in can-do America, and the author, dance critic for The Washington Post for almost 20 years, has a Pulitzer Prize in her pocket.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/20/books/review/the-art-of-grace-by-sarah-l-kaufman.html

This month, a measure of tranquillity has arrived in the form of Espace Clé de Peau Beauté, the new counter — and treatment room — for Shiseido’s prestige brand. The counter, an exercise in luxe minimalism with a Mondrian-style navy-and-white geometric facade, hides the 80-square-foot treatment room, which is closely modeled after the line’s first treatment space in Tokyo’s Ginza district. (Creating the tucked-away haven for facial treatments required some architectural finagling: namely, removing an office and storage room on the beauty floor.) As in the Japanese space, clean lines dominate the room, with products, linens and robes stored away to keep the focus on the treatment chair — and the person in it. Guests can choose from a small menu of treatment options, including the brand’s signature eight-step Synactif intensive purifying & brightening facial ($100), which is designed to encourage lymphatic drainage and which makes use of Clé de Peau Beauté’s proprietary treatment machine.

2015-12-21,‘The Great British Baking Show’ Is the Key to Understanding Today’s Britain,Does “Britain” even exist anymore? And is an aggressively quaint reality show about baking the best answer to that question?,"It is becoming increasingly clear that Britain no longer really exists. I’m not sure exactly how long this has been going on. Last year, for instance, the nation formed from the 1707 Act of Union between the English and Scottish crowns very nearly tore itself apart de jure, holding a nervous and fractured referendum on Scottish independence. The vote was eventually won by the “No” camp, preserving Britain as a political entity, but it was clear the moral victory had been lost regardless. The “Yes” campaign made an exciting and convincing case for an independent Scotland, to which people could be proud to belong. The “No” campaign, by contrast, utterly failed to make anything like a case for Britain as a concept — only a case that it was safer financially to preserve it. (For the time being, anyway: With our government apparently engaged in the project of extracting as much short-term value from the nation’s assets as possible, you worry that the very ground beneath your feet might vanish the moment it ceases to help some banker in London’s spreadsheet add up.)",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/21/magazine/the-great-british-baking-show-is-the-key-to-understanding-todays-britain.html

2015-12-24,Inside the List,"James Rollins’s “The Bone Labyrinth,” new at No. 9 on the combined fiction list, is crammed as usual with a gleefully preposterous mix of science and legend and wild-eyed conspiracy theory.","In With the New: James Rollins’s latest Sigma Force thriller, “The Bone Labyrinth” — new at No. 9 on the combined fiction list — is crammed as usual with a gleefully preposterous mix of science and legend and wild-eyed conspiracy theory, stuffed in so willy-nilly you suspect Rollins had to sit on the book just to get it closed. The plot this time has something to do with genetically engineered superhumans and the Apollo 11 moon landing and the supposed remains of Adam and Eve, which gives you an idea why Rollins sells so many copies; he’s what you might end up with if you tossed Michael Crichton and Dan Brown into a particle accelerator together. Rollins has long been an unabashed book nerd — in high school, he wore a “Keep On Tolkien” T-shirt — but he didn’t try his hand at writing novels until he had worked for some years as a veterinarian. That career influenced his thinking in this book, he told The Fort Worth Star-­Telegram, especially about evolution and intelligence: “I wanted to explore one of the big anthropological mysteries: How come, even though the human brain has remained about the same size for the past 200,000 years, there was a sudden explosion of ingenuity and creativity about 50,000 years ago? Anthropologists call it the Great Leap Forward, and it has baffled them as to what exactly the trigger for it was. Why did human intelligence suddenly surge ahead? I also had a file on Neanderthals. I found it curious that, at roughly the same time, 50,000 years ago, Neanderthals and modern man started to interact and breed, passing Neanderthal DNA into our lineage. No one has addressed the possibility that maybe this was the trigger. I have a background as a veterinarian, so I’m familiar with the fact that if you cross a donkey and a horse to get a mule, the mule has been shown to be a more intelligent animal than the donkey or the horse. I started thinking, ‘What if this kind of crossbreeding is the source of the Great Leap Forward?’ That’s how my stories build. I ponder these different concepts, I blend the science and the history, and the stories begin to layer like an onion, one layer upon another upon another.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/03/books/review/inside-the-list.html

In the opening poem, “Reverse Voyage,” Jackson tells us where that is: “I come / back to unlit alleys, avenues in sheaths of grit / and utility wires like veins stitched to power supplies / buzzing above a different kind of hum.” The utility wires run like veins through the speaker as well, and we realize this reverse voyage is not a return trip but a confirmation that no matter how far the speaker journeys — for success, for beauty, for his art, for his woman — he carries home in his blood.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/27/books/review/roll-deep-by-major-jackson.html

At a time when most art photographers produced what Walker Evans described as “misty October lanes, snow scenes, reflets dans l’eau, young girls with crystal balls,” Sander’s documentary approach came as a clarifying, astringent solution. Here were men and women, children and old folks, farmers and bohemians, bricklayers and engineers, all portrayed with startling lucidity.

2015-12-24,James Tate’s ‘Dome of the Hidden Pavilion’,Stylized narratives conjure a small-town world of traumatized war veterans and exploding cows.,"James Tate, who died in July at age 71, was the rare American poet who managed to make poems that were at once fanciful and grave, mundane and transcendent: He believed “the challenge is always to find the ultimate / in the ordinary.” That quotation captures some of Tate’s American plain-spokenness but not the dark currents of beauty he is capable of, or the way the “ultimate” becomes a tonic, in his poems, for the chaos around us. His work is singular in American poetry for marrying goofball humor and childish jouissance to a lyricism that never seems cheap or self-serious — an unusual achievement. Now we have his 17th book of verse, “Dome of the Hidden Pavilion,” which, like many of his recent books, is composed of prose-poem-like narratives about surreal small-town encounters. Inside its hidden pavilion, we find invisible alligators, toy soldiers that turn out to be alive, traumatized war veterans, exploding cows, existential despair. This is the Tate mode: serious absurdism, absurd seriousness.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/27/books/review/james-tates-dome-of-the-hidden-pavilion.html

Anne Boyer has not forgotten this. She has written a sad, beautiful, passionate book that registers the political economy of literature and of life itself. This sounds dry, abstract: It’s not. Boyer’s book moves as if the contents of a ­brokenhearted country song were mediated through the ferocious mind of a Hannah Arendt. Boyer offers a self-portrait of the artist in a time of “indentured moods,” debt collection, chemical spills, amid her attempts at and refusals of writing, sewing and the daily care of herself and her small daughter.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/27/books/review/anne-boyers-garments-against-women.html

2015-12-30,Burkina Faso: First New Leader in Decades Is Sworn In,The inauguration of Roch Marc Christian Kaboré drew officials from eight other West African countries and thousands of supporters.," The first new leader of Burkina Faso in almost three decades was officially sworn in Tuesday as president, capping more than a year of political turbulence that began when the country’s longtime leader sought to extend his rule. The inauguration of Roch Marc Christian Kaboré drew officials from eight other West African countries and thousands of supporters, news services reported. Mr. Kaboré, a former prime minister, won an election last month that outside observers described as the first free and competitive vote in the country in decades. Burkina Faso’s former leader Blaise Compaoré was deposed in October 2014 after protests over his attempt to amend the Constitution and extend his 27 years in power. This month a military court in Burkina Faso issued an arrest warrant for Mr. Compaoré, who lives in exile in Ivory Coast, in connection with the 1987 assassination of Capt. Thomas Sankara, the country’s revolutionary leader. Mr. Compaoré has denied involvement in the killing.

Many years later, Retief’s legacy — a thorny mix of heroism, nationalism and racism — haunts his fictional descendant, Frank McAllister, the present-day narrator of Justin Cartwright’s latest novel, “Up Against the Night.” The battle provides the only sound archival root for what becomes a gratifyingly unsound psychological odyssey.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/03/books/review/up-against-the-night-by-justin-cartwright.html

Between his birth in Mexicali in 1953 and his death at 58, he published 20 books of fiction and poetry, all of them consistently unpredictable.

Washington once wrote in a letter that he believed an Illuminati conspiracy was at work in America, while Trump is the figurehead of the birther movement, which claims Barack Obama is not a natural-born American citizen. The psychologist and science journalist Rob Brotherton’s new book, “Suspicious Minds: Why We Believe Conspiracy ­Theories,” helps explain why someone with such seemingly outlandish views can gain widespread public support.

A master of the domestic, Holland takes us again into that sphere: into the life of Bird, a stay-at-home mother of two children, as she moves through the events of a single day. Bird readies her son for school, sees her husband out the door, takes a bath with the baby. An old friend calls, and they share stories about the past. Bird takes the baby for a walk, and they stop by a pond, enjoying some time on the grass. Returning home, she flips through a photo album, talks on the phone again and hangs up in time to share the last moments of sunlight with the baby before greeting her son at the school bus.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/03/books/review/bird-by-noy-holland.html

Abba Eban, Israel’s eloquent and admired representative to the United Nations, thought the response was over the top and wrote a letter to Prime Minister David Ben-­Gurion condemning the raid. At the United Nations, meanwhile, Eban defended the operation, assailing Syria’s implacable hostility.

For instance, I recall the day at my English boarding school in the early 1960s when our sober, patriotic old history books were gathered up and carted away to a storeroom.

Washington","A survey of research presses the case that infections, even in the womb, are linked to mental illnesses like schizophrenia.","One hundred and sixty odd years ago, Ignaz Semmelweis realized that physicians who didn’t wash their hands were carrying tiny germs from bedside to bedside and causing the childbed fever that killed many women. After doctors began washing their hands, fewer women died. The series of realizations in the 19th century that germs — bacteria and viruses — caused diseases like cholera and tuberculosis and influenza ushered in modern medicine. Mortality rates declined; children lived longer. Germ theory had a dramatic clarity to it. It pushed medicine away from holistic conceptions of illness as imbalance toward conceptions of illness as a specific entity. You get the germ, you fall sick, you take antibiotics or fight it off (or die). Ironically, though, the tidiness of this relationship helped obscure cases where germs may have less direct but still devastating effects — a complex reality we are now beginning to understand better.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/03/books/review/infectious-madness-by-harriet-a-washington.html

2015-12-31,Review: Squeak Carnwath Speaks With Her Varied Palette,Ms. Carnwath’s exhibit at Jane Lombard Gallery is her first solo show in New York in more than a decade.,"Over the decades, Squeak Carnwath has cultivated a distinctive blend of disparate 1970s art movements, including New Image painting, Conceptual Art and above all Process Art. In her first solo show in New York in over a decade, her paintings fluently speak several languages at once. Areas of flat color are adrift with abstract and representational elements as well as writing — passing thoughts, the news, quips — often partly submerged in the shuffle of erasures and new additions. Everything contributes to the commentary. Tracts of cursive consider the income gap or light pollution, while little blocks of color allude to abstraction and a compass rose conjures cartography and sign painting.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/01/arts/design/review-squeak-carnwath-speaks-with-her-varied-palette.html
