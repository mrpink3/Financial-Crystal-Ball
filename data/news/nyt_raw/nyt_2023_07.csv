I hadn’t planned to taste any wine, content to take in the city’s peculiar West Coast weirdness, but a friend who worked for a food magazine said that I had to meet this winemaker who worked like an artist. She might have used the word “genius.” I mentioned Harrison to another friend, who’s in the wine business. He echoed the recommendation, describing her ambiguously as a person who had “declared war on wine.” Everywhere I looked online, Harrison was receiving accolades for the results of an unorthodox approach to winemaking, which drew as much from painting — she has a condition known as synesthesia, in which information meant to stimulate one sense also stimulates others — as it did from traditional notions of taste and aroma. Some critics let on that her wines had the complexity, tension and narrative arc of a great artwork. So I sent Harrison an email and received a response that began unenthusiastically with, “Unfortunately it is well known that I don’t like all that many humans.” She seemed to mean it.

It borrows prose’s linear momentum but refuses the carelessness of prose’s wraparound ends. The power of these lines is, in part, generated by their quick liftoffs — each begins with a word of a single syllable. This is paired with cunning line breaks that enjamb, suggest, double the words that surround them and intensify the effect of the poem by giving it both vertical and horizontal motion. Throughout, there is thick sound stacked on thick sound, the diction mixed and surprising, the everyday and the erudite sparking like flint and steel. In my reading of the poem, it is as if the line is seeking to enact the poem’s proposition: that in the motion of scattering, in an orientation of disorientation, a possibility of liberation might be found.

Westerly Canteen’s trailer holds a compact kitchen with cream-painted walls and blond wood counters. “I had this wild idea, like, ‘What if we took the food truck concept and put it in a space that is still mobile but feels beautiful and welcoming?’” Levine said as she stirred a pot of golden-hued stock, fragrant with spring onion and green garlic. Levine, who previously worked at the Berkeley, Calif., restaurant Chez Panisse, founded Westerly with her partner, Alex Kaindl, a farmer who tends half an acre in Sharon, Conn. Nearly all of their ingredients are sourced from farms nearby. (Starting this month, Kaindl’s crops will also be incorporated.) Developing the weekly menu is a puzzle that requires maximizing limited space and resources. “A lot of our decisions are very creative and passion driven but also very practical,” Kaindl said as Levine ladled the stock over a plate of nettle-stuffed ravioli. “We slice up the spring onions that go into the dish, and the tops are made into the broth,” Levine said. “We’re using every piece of the onion.” The founders hope to engage the surrounding community while also drawing diners from afar. They’ve partnered with Tenmile Distillery, which offers cocktails made with local ingredients to go alongside Westerly’s menu (their take on a Negroni includes Faccia Brutto bitters from Brooklyn, Method sweet vermouth from Romulus and gin made on-site at Tenmile). “We really want people to sit here and stay a while,” Levine said. westerlycanteen.com.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/06/t-magazine/hawaii-surfboards-bizia-oahu.html

2023-07-07,Five Children’s Movies to Stream Now,"This month’s picks include a sweet dragon tale, the new “Avatar” installment and an updated Cinderella story.","“My Father’s Dragon,” an adaptation of the 1948 children’s novel of the same name by Ruth Stiles Gannett, follows a young boy named Elmer (Jacob Tremblay, recently the voice of Flounder in “The Little Mermaid”) who is living a blissful life with his mother, Dela (Golshifteh Farahani). When Dela’s business shuts down, it forces her to move to a city tenement and scramble for work. A black cat (voiced by Whoopi Goldberg) tells Elmer to journey to a place called Wild Island and free a dragon named Boris, who can, in turn, bring fame and fortune to Dela. Elmer finds Boris (Gaten Matarazzo of “Stranger Things”) and what ensues is a tender story of friendship, fear and bravery. Beautiful hand-drawn animation and wide-eyed characters are a signature of Cartoon Saloon, the Oscar-nominated Irish animation studio that produced this film along with Netflix and Mockingbird Pictures. And thanks to the director Nora Twomey (“The Breadwinner”) and the screenwriter Meg LeFauve (“Inside Out”), both Oscar nominees, this 2022 film’s sweet, important lessons — that it’s OK to be scared sometimes and that bonds between friends give us courage — are made digestible for young children.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/07/movies/kids-movies-streaming.html

2023-07-07,Five Science Fiction Movies to Stream Now,This month’s picks include a hiking trip gone wrong and a luxury vacation that takes a depraved turn.,"Dan Berk and Robert Olsen’s film starts with a mysterious red flare streaking down from the sky, so right away we suspect who (or what) will trigger the plot. And it might not be friendly, because the odds of a backpacking trip going right in a sci-fi movie are fairly low. Indeed, things quickly go awry after Harry (Jake Lacy, from Season 1 of “The White Lotus”) and his girlfriend, Ruth (Maika Monroe, “It Follows”), take off on an isolated Oregon trail. She is wracked by anxiety so crippling that she has been taking medication and seeing a therapist, but gamely tries to not spoil a trip Jake has carefully planned. And then, of course, it all goes to pot, with a couple of nifty red herrings and plot twists spicing up the script. “Significant Other” (the title cleverly plays off a couple of different meanings) is a tight, effective hybrid of science fiction and horror, with the scares generated less by shock tactics than by a growing dread. That anguish is generated in the viewer in part by good filmmaking — the movie is briskly paced, well acted and moodily atmospheric (only the C.G.I. looks a little cheap). And partly it derives from “Significant Other” dealing with common preoccupations: Do we ever fully know who we lie next to?",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/07/movies/science-fiction-movies-streaming.html

Despite what may be recalled through the penumbra of memory, this sudden silence was not directly preceded by either of Cruise’s infamous appearances on television: not by his NBC’s “Today” show interview (in which he labeled host Matt Lauer both “glib” and “Matt — MattMattMattMatt”), nor even by his appearance on “The Oprah Winfrey Show” (in which he reverse-catapulted himself onto Winfrey’s fawn-colored couch multiple times in a demonstration of his enthusiasm for Holmes).

Now it is finally swaggering onto supermarket shelves and online. Eric Skae, the chief executive of Carbone Fine Foods, said the goal was to replicate the restaurant experience, and that took a long time at the stove. For freshness, they wound up omitting the usual cream from the tomato and Calabrian chile mixture. Instructions on the label have you add it at home. Vodka sauce, pink, spicy, packing some heat but rarely tasting of vodka, may have originated in New York or in Italy decades ago; its popularity is undimmed. So much so that earlier this year, Heinz in England introduced its version of vodka sauce in collaboration with Absolut, the vodka company with its name on the label. In the United States, jarred vodka sauces are ubiquitous on supermarket shelves.

As depressing as the outcomes often were, these tortuous paths of jurisprudence were often absurd. A closer look at the opinions helps illustrate how legal decision-making is often deeply entwined with the justices’ deeply held passions and religious beliefs, their occasionally tense relationships with their colleagues and their personality quirks. Here are a few mostly tin medals for the outstanding lowlights (and a few highlights) of the year.",Opinion,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/18/opinion/supreme-court-big-decisions.html

2023-07-18,Wikipedia’s Moment of Truth,Can the online encyclopedia help teach A.I. chatbots to get their facts right — without destroying itself in the process?,"In early 2021, a Wikipedia editor peered into the future and saw what looked like a funnel cloud on the horizon: the rise of GPT-3, a precursor to the new chatbots from OpenAI. When this editor — a prolific Wikipedian who goes by the handle Barkeep49 on the site — gave the new technology a try, he could see that it was untrustworthy. The bot would readily mix fictional elements (a false name, a false academic citation) into otherwise factual and coherent answers. But he had no doubts about its potential. “I think A.I.’s day of writing a high-quality encyclopedia is coming sooner rather than later,” he wrote in “Death of Wikipedia,” an essay that he posted under his handle on Wikipedia itself. He speculated that a computerized model could, in time, displace his beloved website and its human editors, just as Wikipedia had supplanted the Encyclopaedia Britannica, which in 2012 announced it was discontinuing its print publication.

ChatGPT, the artificial-intelligence-powered tool from OpenAI, can analyze images, too — describing what’s in them, answering questions about them and even recognizing specific people’s faces. The hope is that, eventually, someone could upload a picture of a broken-down car’s engine or a mysterious rash and ChatGPT could suggest the fix.",Technology,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/18/technology/openai-chatgpt-facial-recognition.html

I asked Shimoda about the context and composition of this poem, and his answer was a skillful, evocative illumination of the relationship between life and poetry: “I wrote this poem the night after going out on a water drop with a humanitarian-aid group. We drove for many hours through the desert, putting water out for migrants, people trying to stay alive. We met a man who, in the hallucinatory heat of Arizona, asked how far it was to Kentucky. Some important part of an individual exists in the places they are trying to reach, and it is excruciating. It is like we are following the signs and symbols of our future selves through the wilderness. I write poetry when I am feeling haunted by something — an image, encounter — although not as a means of exorcism. I think about what I have seen, heard, experienced, and I go under. I write poetry at night, partly because I believe there is a more humane, trustworthy logic to be found there, although like dreams, and like the landscapes in which they graze, the poems are themselves the interpretation.” Selected by Anne Boyer",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/20/magazine/poem-the-desert.html

The dam’s spillway, a concrete channel capable of moving millions of gallons of water out of the reservoir in seconds, was disintegrating in front of them. If it had to be taken out of service, a serious rainstorm, like the one that had been falling on Northern California for days, could cause the dam — the tallest in the United States — to fail.",Podcasts,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/23/podcasts/the-daily/the-sunday-read-the-trillion-gallon-question.html

2023-07-24,"Host Gift Guide: Fun Ferments, Cozy Quilts and More","What T Magazine’s editors and contributors are bringing to thank their hosts this summer, including surrealistic serving spoons and bubbles to entertain children.","When the French interior designer Camille Vergnes throws a dinner party in Paris, she opts for unfussy white table linens and white plates. This allows her Art Deco-style set of serving spoons, salad servers and carving knives, all with almond green shagreen handles, to take center stage. “I use [the serving set] as the key piece of the table along with the flowers or candleholders,” she says. Vergnes’s approach reflects a shift in focus when it comes to tableware, away from handblown glassware and patterned napkins to sculptural utensils. In Copenhagen, stirred by her homeland’s history of silversmithing, the Danish jeweler Olga Bonne has added delicate hand-wrought silver spoons, forks and knives with handles in the shape of fish, kestrels or hares to her roster of whimsical creations. She takes inspiration from eras past, “when arts and crafts did not have to be functional but most of all ornamental and extravagant,” she says. Some designers are marrying the functional and fanciful: In Brighton, the British designer Alessandra Williams recently launched her namesake homeware label with sets of hand-carved salad servers in green leopard stone and blackened jacaranda wood made by Fair Trade co-operatives in Zimbabwe and Nairobi.

More than three years into the pandemic and untold millions of people dead, that question about the Covid-19 coronavirus remains controversial and fraught, with facts sparkling amid a tangle of analyses and hypotheticals like Christmas lights strung on a dark, thorny tree. One school of thought holds that the virus, known to science as SARS-CoV-2, spilled into humans from a nonhuman animal, probably in the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, a messy emporium in Wuhan, China, brimming with fish, meats and wildlife on sale as food. Another school argues that the virus was laboratory-engineered to infect humans and cause them harm — a bioweapon — and was possibly devised in a “shadow project” sponsored by the People’s Liberation Army of China. A third school, more moderate than the second but also implicating laboratory work, suggests that the virus got into its first human victim by way of an accident at the Wuhan Institute of Virology (W.I.V.), a research complex on the eastern side of the city, maybe after well-meaning but reckless genetic manipulation that made it more dangerous to people.

True, not every voice is cut out to hold an audience for 10 hours, but even when untrained cadences run flat, a self-narrated memoir carries an emotional authenticity that is impossible to replicate. Here are three new memoirs skillfully narrated by their authors, only one of whom happens to be an actor.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/28/books/review/pageboy-elliot-page-what-the-dead-know-barbara-butcher-the-forgotten-girls-monica-potts.html

But don’t expect it to be a sweeping multigenerational epic; instead, look for something more intimate. This archly observed novel, translated from the Italian by Julia MacGibbon, follows some of the conventions of the genre, allowing a well-stocked cast of characters to be buffeted by the history of 20th-century Italy, but it does so in a playful, kaleidoscopic fashion. Here the often wonderfully eccentric minor characters — chauffeurs, nursemaids, household servants — vie for center stage with the equally eccentric bourgeois clans that employ them.

2023-07-28,Make It New and Difficult: The Music of Arnold Schoenberg,"John Adams reviews “Schoenberg: Why He Matters,” in which Harvey Sachs explores the artistic, academic and spiritual life of a 20th-century cultural giant.","In 1955 Henry Pleasants, a critic of both popular and classical music, issued a cranky screed of a book, “The Agony of Modern Music,” which opened with the implacable verdict that “serious music is a dead art.” Pleasants’s thesis was that the traditional forms of classical music — opera, oratorio, orchestral and chamber music, all constructions of a bygone era — no longer related to the experience of our modern lives. Composers had lost touch with the currents of popular taste, and popular music, with its vitality and its connection to the spirit of the times, had dethroned the classics. Absent the mass appeal enjoyed by past masters like Beethoven, Verdi, Wagner and Tchaikovsky, modern composers had retreated into obscurantism, condemned to a futile search for novelty amid the detritus of a tradition that was, like overworked soil, exhausted and fallow. One could still love classical music, but only with the awareness that it was a relic of the past and in no way representative of our contemporary experience.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/28/books/review/schoenberg-why-he-matters-harvey-sachs.html

2023-07-28,How to Create the Perfect Nonalcoholic Home Bar,"From the essential spirit substitutes and how to mix them to the most striking glasses, everything you need to serve festive zero-proof cocktails.","It’s no secret that nonalcoholic cocktails are suddenly ubiquitous. Whereas until a few years ago, nondrinkers had to make do with cranberry-splashed club soda, now seemingly every noteworthy bar offers a Phony Negroni or a margarita-inspired mocktail. “There are so many people who are nonimbibing, for whatever reason, but who still want to be a part of the mood,” says Stacey Swenson, who designed the menu at the Swan Room bar in downtown Manhattan, which serves drinks including the Champaxne Cocktail (nonalcoholic sparkling wine, orange blossom and bitters) and the Chinola Mule (a tequila alternative with lime, passion fruit and spiced soda). The biggest change: teetotalers aren’t the only ones ordering them. “Nine out of 10 of our customers also drink alcohol,” says Nicholas Bodkins, one of the founders of Boisson, a store specializing in zero-proof spirits. “This is more of an ‘and’ than an ‘or.’” He gives credit for this shift to distillers, who, refining early iterations that often tasted soapy or medicinal, have figured out how to effectively extract the flavors of botanicals without the use of ethanol. Today, the best bitter aperitifs (the term for nonalcoholic alternatives to spirits like Campari and Aperol) have all the complexity and layered flavors of their boozy counterparts. They’re also easy to find — Boisson, for example, has locations in New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco and a forthcoming Miami store, in addition to an online shop — which makes stocking a home bar with nonalcoholic options a breeze. Here, the best bottles and other ingredients to have on hand. — Oliver Strand",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/28/t-magazine/nonalcoholic-home-bar-guide.html
