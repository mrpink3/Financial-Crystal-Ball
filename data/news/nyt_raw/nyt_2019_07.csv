In Season 3 (spoiler alert!), tensions rise as Robert’s wedding draws closer and he and Frances butt heads over their parenting styles. On the sidelines, Diane (Molly Shannon) searches for independence while her husband sits in prison, and Dallas (Talia Balsam) wrestles with a midlife crisis.

Once, using the subtlest of shot fakes, Durant sent LeBron James sliding helplessly to the floor, out of bounds, and then cruised politely forward for two points.

None of that will intimidate Kyrgios, the enigmatic player who can throw tantrums one minute and make subliminally difficult shots the next. Kyrgios has beaten Nadal three times, including in the fourth round at Wimbledon in 2014, when Nadal was the No. 1 seed. After Kyrgios defeated Nadal at the Acapulco Open in February, Nadal said he “lacks respect for the crowd, his opponent and towards himself.” Kyrgios lived up to this description in his first-round match, a five-set spectacle against Jordan Thompson, in which he alternated between joking with the crowd, admonishing himself for poor decision making, and trying to be conciliatory. Late Wednesday night, Kyrgios was even spotted by reporters at a Wimbledon Village bar.

Season 2 ramped up the emotion and romance amid the chaos. Season 3 finds the friends in the summer between middle school and high school — so it’ll probably be downright terrifying. (In an interview with The New York Times, the actor Cary Elwes, who plays the town mayor this season, mentioned “Fast Times at Ridgemont High” as a primary influence for Season 3.)

Sure, Freddie Mercury and his bandmates were from England, but Queen’s music continues to reverberate across American culture, a phenomenon this Academy Award-winning biopic explores. Rami Malek (wearing a convincing set of prosthetic teeth) plays the Queen frontman in the film, which charts the band’s dazzling rise and experimental songwriting, alongside some of Mercury’s personal struggles. Although Malek’s performance earned him an Oscar for best actor, the New York Times critic A.O.

And a new documentary series about the space race comes to PBS.,"SCREAM: RESURRECTION 9 p.m. on VH1. When this television adaptation of Wes Craven’s horror franchise debuted in 2015, critics argued that the story didn’t pack the same punch on the small screen. Some said the series lacked novelty and that the Ghostface killer doesn’t send chills down your spine over 10 drawn-out episodes. Season 3 brings the show from MTV to VH1 and packs terror in three two-hour episodes airing over three nights. The unlucky protagonist is Deion (RJ Cyler), a high school jock in Atlanta who is haunted by the death of his brother and by a mysterious killer who is sending him eerie messages. After Deion lands in detention, he and a few classmates form the “Deadfast Club” and set out to find the man behind the mask. As in previous seasons, “Resurrection” offers plenty of meta references: One character plainly states, “We’re in a horror movie.” Another says, “This here is a reboot, and reboots don’t play by your rules.” ",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/08/arts/television/whats-on-tv-monday-scream-and-chasing-the-moon.html

The fabled Shangri-La recording studio in Malibu, Calif., was once a hangout for the Band and Bob Dylan. Now, it’s an oasis overseen by the megaproducer Rick Rubin — and a reflection of Rubin’s minimalist sensibilities. So it makes sense as a setting for this four-part documentary from the director Morgan Neville (“Won’t You Be My Neighbor?”), which takes a meandering dive into Rubin’s life and work as a producer. The fact that Rubin has worked across so many genres (his best-known collaborations include producing for acts like the Beastie Boys and Johnny Cash) means that this dive should have something for everyone. But as the title suggests, the star may be the studio itself. “There’s an extra, added feeling of coming to a place where a lot of good music has been made,” Rubin says in the first episode. “I don’t know if it’s the energy collected in the space, or if it’s just people’s belief,” he adds. “It doesn’t really matter.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/12/arts/television/whats-on-tv-friday-shangri-la-and-two-denzel-washington-movies.html

At night, in a dark cabin, a girl told the rest of us about her older sister’s friend. Or maybe her friend’s older cousin: one of those twice-removed protagonists of a supposedly true account. She wasn’t a murder victim; rather, she’d had a close call, a near miss, with a man who later turned out to be a serial killer, the perpetrator of what became known as the Michigan Murders. She’d been walking home late at night from a party in Ann Arbor when a good-looking guy on a blue motorcycle pulled up next to her, offering a ride. She felt a warning twinge, said no thanks and watched him drive off. The next day the cops found a young woman who had been strangled and raped, a tree branch shoved up her vagina.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/16/books/review/kate-tuttle-true-crime-women.html

Anya Corson, the founder and chief executive of the St. Louis company, drew upon her culinary school training to create the probiotic preserve. The honey, added ingredients and splash of apple cider vinegar are all raw and organic, as is the wild yeast that works on the mixture over its three-month fermentation.

The often ludicrous dialogue — even when sober, which isn’t often, characters strain to sell their lines — suggests a comedy, as does acting so lamentable it seems cruel to identify its perpetrators. Then there’s the serial-killer plotline, which nudges the movie into thriller territory, even as the frequency of food-drenched orgies and full-frontal photo shoots tip the whole into soft-core pornography. The movie’s tagline is “A Gangster Fairytale;” but whatever is going on here, I suspect only the writer and director, Adam Sherman, knows for sure.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/18/movies/shes-just-a-shadow-review.html

But in 1965, a crane operator lowered a colossal Olmec sculpture of a head onto the corporation’s Manhattan doorstep. The artwork was awe-inspiring enough that its next stop was the World’s Fair, but, for a time, it sat in front of Seagram’s new Mies van der Rohe skyscraper on Park Avenue. Hosting the sculpture was an audacious move on the company’s part. The juxtaposition of the Olmecs’ pockmarked basalt and the building’s sleek glass and bronze exterior made a statement about where mankind had been and where it was going. Also, intentionally or not, it was a pretty epic pun on the phrase “how to get ahead in business.”",Business Day,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/19/business/when-corporate-lobbies-started-to-look-like-museum-galleries.html

While this Oscar-winning drama about Neil Armstrong touches on the space race and the political issues the moon landing raised at home, it focuses on the personal and professional setbacks Armstrong overcame before taking that small step in 1969. “Feelings are the film’s fuel,” A.O. Scott wrote in his New York Times review. “Like some of the ancient epics ‘First Man’ is primarily a character study, a space odyssey with a diffident and enigmatic Ulysses at its center."" Ryan Gosling, collaborating with “La La Land” director Damien Chazelle for the second time, portrays the astronaut in the years leading up to the Apollo 11 launch. The screenplay draws from James R. Hansen’s biography and contrasts Armstrong’s reserved, hard-to-read temperament with the larger-than-life job he has shouldered. We watch as he and his wife (Claire Foy) grieve over the loss of their daughter, prepare for the launch and wrestle with the fact that Armstrong could go down in history as the first man to walk on the moon — or perish in outer space.

This documentary tells the story of Nora Sandigo, a Miami woman who serves as the guardian to more than 1,000 children who were born in the United States to undocumented immigrants. Sandigo, who fled Nicaragua as a teenager, moved to Florida in the late 1980s, where she started working for an organization that helped immigrants with documentation. After President Trump took office, many parents in the immigrant community started to give Sandigo power of attorney, so that she could make decisions for their United States-born children, should they be deported. This designation protects the children in Sandigo’s care from entering the foster care system, keeping them from being legally separated from their parents. When Sandigo is not making grocery runs, contacting lawyers or trying to find beds for the hundreds of people she looks after, she makes trips to Washington to meet with lawmakers to discuss immigration policy. The filmmakers Dave LaMattina and Chad Walker followed Sandigo over two years during and following the 2016 election for this documentary.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/22/arts/television/whats-on-tv-monday-the-great-mother-and-time-freak.html

2019-07-23,How to Dive for Pearls,Feel for the mussels in the muddy riverbed. Check the ones with misshapen shells. Don’t expect to make a living this way.,"“Run your hands back and forth through the sediment at the bottom of the river,” says Chuck Work, who has spent much of the last 25 years underwater, crawling the muddy bed of the Tennessee River, feeling for mussels with his hands. Misshapen shells are much likelier to contain freshwater pearls than more uniform ones. Open any deformed bivalve you find by sticking a knife in its hinge. “Twist the blade and it pops open,” Work says. Squeeze the soft meat in your hand, feeling for something hard. On a typical day, Work will collect as many as 1,500 mussels and check only a few for pearls; his more dependable pay comes from selling the shells to a company that ships them to China and Japan, where they are cut into tiny pieces and forced into oysters, becoming the nuclei of cultured pearls. Only about one in 10,000 mussels contains a commercially valuable wild pearl. “You can’t make a living diving for pearls,” Work says. “Think of them as a bonus.”",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/23/magazine/how-to-dive-for-pearls.html

The chefs and partners, Kevin Chen and Tashi Gyamtso, decided to incorporate the word “red,” often used in China, in the name, which also refers to the story, already an internet chronicle, of Kyle MacDonald, who parlayed a red paper clip into a two-story house after a series of trades. “It’s our philosophy, always moving forward, moving up,” Mr. Chen said. So far, the two men, who have no formal culinary training and met while working several years ago at Blue Hill at Stone Barns, have gone from the bottom of the professional kitchen ladder to working in New York establishments like Soho House; One if by Land, Two if by Sea; and the Dutch, as well as Alinea, in Chicago, and Apis, near Austin, Tex. Before opening Red Paper Clip, a bootstrap affair with no backers, they held pop-up dinners in various places, including an Upper West Side apartment. Mr. Chen, 29, a New Yorker whose parents are from Taiwan, and Mr. Gyamtso, also 29, a Tibetan who came to New York in 2008, are doing all the cooking in an open kitchen at the back of the unadorned 24-seat dining room. (There are eight seats at the bar.) John Parson, the manager, takes care of the beverages. Their food is contemporary, with elements like miso, black garlic, beef tendon and chiles. “The part of Tibet where I’m from is in the east, near Sichuan, so I favor strong flavors,” Mr. Gyamtso said. Mr. Chen said characteristic dishes include oysters with yuzu kosho mignonette, and beef carpaccio with Sichuan seasonings, puffed tendon and coriander. They’ll continue to serve those dishes when they switch from à la carte to a tasting menu format in about six weeks. They’re just waiting for a new sous-chef to arrive from Texas.

In her 2013 documentary, “The Square,” the director Jehane Noujaim captured Egypt from the winter of 2011 to the summer of 2013, during a time of political unrest and revolution lubricated by social media. The results of Noujaim’s work, A.O. Scott wrote in his review for The New York Times, were “stunning.” This new documentary, made by Noujaim and the filmmaker Karim Amer, is more directly concerned with social networks: It turns its attention to the commodification of personal data, with a focus on the Cambridge Analytica scandal and the way American Facebook users’ data was harvested in the lead-up to the 2016 election. The principal figure through which that story gets dissected is Brittany Kaiser, a former Cambridge Analytica executive who became an outspoken defector. Also interviewed are the whistle-blower Christopher Wylie and the journalist Carole Cadwalladr, who was an author of a collaborative report between The Times and The Observer that exposed how Cambridge Analytica harvested the information of tens of millions of Facebook users.

It shows Mandy lying on the floor unconscious, while her crush (Nicholas Galitzine) removes her clothes. But it’s what the video doesn’t show that propels the film, as Mandy works to uncover the truth, growing more isolated in the process. “Bianco uses a depressingly familiar story of high-school partying gone wrong to explore sometimes uncomfortable questions about gender, agency and collective guilt,” Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times.

Ms. Feiring, whose middle name should be “terroir,” starts by describing what natural wine is not: It lacks the fruit, power and oak of some high-end wines. Ms. Feiring takes the same approach to wine as she does to food, avoiding anything highly processed and additive-laden, and explains all the additives used in conventional wine production that natural winemakers don’t use. But she also gets into weedy details; amateurs might prefer to ignore sections on stuff like reverse-osmosis and infusion, and concentrate instead on how wine gets its color, the use or presence of sulfur in wine, how to find natural wines and why you should care. And if you’re planning a trip to France or a few other countries and want to visit natural wineries, she includes some guidance.",Food,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/29/dining/drinks/natural-wine-for-the-people-book-alice-feiring.html

In this case, those sensibilities even carry over into fake commercials for real products like VHS tapes — “watch movies in your own house for just 200 dollars a tape!” — and the dating website Black People Meet. In a recent interview with The New York Times, Salahuddin described the show as an “an absurd, heightened world where we can play.” He added, “It allows us to tap into that other part of our brain that’s silly and carefree.” And in a review for The Times, Mike Hale called the show “a pure jolt of stylized nostalgia, from its affectionate sendups of soul, R&B and hip-hop to its candy-colored sets with their abstract cutouts, traversed by roller-skating dancers.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/31/arts/television/whats-on-tv-wednesday-shermans-showcase-and-jane-the-virgin.html

Hayden, anonymously published his observations in an essay for The Atlantic Monthly. The severe effects of combat-related injuries, like the ones Hayden described in his essay, drew more public attention during the 1920s, when the figure of the shellshocked veteran became part of larger debates over the government’s responsibility to care for its military forces.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/31/magazine/world-war-i-veterans-treatment.html
