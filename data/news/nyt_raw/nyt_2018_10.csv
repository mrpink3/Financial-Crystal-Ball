2018-10-02,"The Woo SoHo Opens, Updating a Korean Trailblazer","The latest from Harris Salat in Downtown Brooklyn, a steakhouse featuring inventive dumplings, and more restaurant news.","Is this the name of a new bridal shop? Hardly. But those who have followed the Korean restaurant scene over the years will recognize the update of one of its pioneers, the elegant Woo Lae Oak, which opened in SoHo in 1999 and closed seven years ago. It was founded by Young Sook Choi, the mother of the new Woo’s present owner, Julie Choi, whose grandmother brought a branch of Woo Lae Oak from Seoul, South Korea, to Midtown Manhattan in 1974. The new restaurant, which can seat up to 150, occupies the multistory brick-walled space that was Fiamma, then Costata. The ground floor, with a bar and an open kitchen counter, is more intimate than the upstairs.

Whatever the era, the director or the headliners, it relates the story of two lovers on dramatically differing paths: a famous man who’s furiously racing to the bottom (Bradley Cooper in this movie) and a woman (Lady Gaga) who’s soaring to the top. This latest and fourth version is a gorgeous heartbreaker (bring tissues). Like its finest antecedents, it wrings tears from its romance and thrills from a steadfast belief in old-fashioned, big-feeling cinema. That it’s also a perverse fantasy about men, women, love and sacrifice makes it all the better.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/03/movies/a-star-is-born-review-lady-gaga-bradley-cooper.html

They were both students: Clémentine from Brittany, and Abdel-Razak, on scholarship, from a village in Syria. Riad was born in 1978. With a young child and a newly minted doctorate in history, Abdel-Razak — whose stated aspiration for his son, to become “the Arab of the future,” lends Sattouf’s autobiographical series its name — moved his family to Libya for a teaching position before eventually landing in Syria, in the Sunni village of Ter Maaleh, where he had grown up. Sattouf’s graphic narratives of his country-and-culture-hopping childhood — of which, with THE ARAB OF THE FUTURE 3: A Childhood in the Middle East, 1985-1987 (Metropolitan/Holt, $27), we now have three volumes in an ongoing story — are translated from the French by Sam Taylor. They reveal the easy charm also displayed in Marjane Satrapi’s “Persepolis” volumes, setting up a central, and often amusing, tension between a pictured child protagonist and that same person’s adult, retrospective narration.

Here, he shares his many inspirations with T.","“I wasn’t even remotely interested in fashion,” the accessories designer Pierre Hardy says of his Parisian childhood. “My mother was a ballet instructor and my father taught athletics, so the only kind of clothing that caught my attention was super sporty, like high-tech ski suits.” Hardy, too, was passionate about dance as well as drawing, disciplines he pursued even as he worked toward a teaching degree in plastic arts from the École Normale Supérieure Paris-Saclay in Cachan. After graduation, he joined a modern dance troupe and drew illustrations for European fashion magazines such as Vanity Fair Italia and Vogue Hommes. In 1987, he took a position styling shoes at Christian Dior, and so began his distinguished career in fashion. Hermès was next to notice Hardy’s talents, naming him creative director of its men’s and women’s shoes in 1990 — and, later, of its haute joaillerie. In 1999, he started his own label, known for its color-blocked saddlebags and men’s sneakers. Soon after, Nicolas Ghesquière, then the designer of Balenciaga, asked him to oversee women’s shoes for the brand — a decade-long collaboration that resulted in some of Hardy’s most beloved designs, including his futuristic Lego sandal and platform Oxfords with Formica-tiled heels.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/12/t-magazine/fashion/pierre-hardy-inspiration.html

It is told by an unnamed narrator who recounts struggling with the decision of whether to have children with her partner, Johannes. (In real life, Ms. Greengrass has two young children.) Told in patient, psychologically complex prose, “Sight” combines the narrator’s thoughts about her own mother, who died several years earlier, and her remembrances of her grandmother, a psychoanalyst, with her relevant digressions about scientific history. (Real-life figures contemplated in the book include Sigmund Freud; Wilhelm Röntgen, who discovered X-rays; and John Hunter, an 18th-century surgeon and anatomist.) The narrator’s thoughts about having children undergirds the story, but the novel is also concerned with the nature of grief, selfhood and memory. Below, Ms. Greengrass talks about the early history of psychoanalysis, writing a novel while starting her own family and more.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/14/books/sight-jessie-greengrass-interview.html

This is especially true for those who see themselves as presiding over the calm — those who will be most surprised when open conflict erupts and they look down from their civil conversations to find weapons in their hands. So if you worry that we may be living through a historic rupture, it might be instructive to look to those most attuned to the status quo, and perhaps most sensitive when it changes: the moderates, those who imagine themselves floating above partisan passions, those who judged the existing order to be working fine. They tend, by nature, to be needle-threaders, nonparticipants, mediators. Their current mood is wistful, but also annoyed and sometimes threatened. Something has been lost in our politics, they say: our civility; our ability to communicate, reason, deliberate. What they mourn above all, though, is the loss of nuance.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/16/magazine/does-this-moment-in-history-call-for-more-nuance-or-less.html

Perhaps the maze is just south of a freeway that you can hear; maybe you can see a mountain in the distance. Note in which direction the corn rows run.

An internal inquiry into one curious case — how did a government official’s son gain admission despite doing poorly on the entrance exam? — had exposed a pattern of fraud and discrimination.

The supposed rationale, that female doctors are prone to leave the profession after marriage or childbirth, only inflamed a national debate on gender inequality.

One of the six cover subjects of T’s 2018 Greats issue, she is among the most radically innovative artists working today. In a career spanning nearly five decades — working across photography, video, installations and public art campaigns — Weems has laid bare the historical biases that guide our own actions and shape our perceptions of others. Take, for example, her series “Museums” (2006–present), in which the artist stares down the pyramidal glass portal to the Louvre, the sinuous curves of the Guggenheim Bilbao, and the august colonnade of the British Museum, as though to challenge the institutions that have long determined what counts as culture and beauty. In this project, and in the dozens more that comprise her practice, Weems addresses questions of power, violence, exclusion, access and authority — especially as they pertain to race and gender — and dares her viewers to do the same. The pathos in all of her works, from intimate photographs of her family to series involving archival images of enslaved Africans, unites her subjects and viewers in a common humanity.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/17/t-magazine/carrie-mae-weems-influence-latoya-ruby-frazier-laurie-simmons.html

In the past, musk has been associated with fragrances that are both dank and overpowering, but that’s becoming less and less true. Because the harvesting of the substance — which comes from the gland of the endangered male musk deer — has been illegal since 1975, all commercial musk is a synthetic interpretation of the actual, animal thing. First synthesized by the chemist Albert Bauer in 1888, artificial musk now encompasses a wide variety of olfactory compounds. Gone are the louche scents of yesteryear. Modern musks can be filthy, dainty, weighty, wispy; in short, they’re unpredictable. But the distinctive quality all musks share is a certain lushness, a tendency to smell as opulent as cashmere feels. Frédéric Malle, the founder of his eponymous French fragrance house, says, “Musk conveys different ideas based on what it is paired with.” Yet a commonality exists: “Very often it makes a perfume more addictive.”",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/18/t-magazine/subtle-musks-men.html

Co-written by the great-grand-nephew of Bram Stoker, this is a fictional prequel to the story of Dracula.

A successful programmer decides to resurrect a failed project from his idealistic youth: inventing a computer that can control every function of a house.

The gasp as your plane hits turbulence and drops; the creeping sensation as the front door squeaks open in the middle of the night; the shudder when you hear the dentist’s drill buzz — we all know fear in some form or another. Fear drives us to do things we might never have considered doing, or to become someone we didn’t plan to be. Fear forces us to choose between safety and risk.

It’s startling to realize as an adult how many of their teachings transcend religion and geography, how the most enduring fairy tales (or their cousins, folklore and fable) are distillations of universal truths and universal fears presented in often-fantastic costumes and contexts: If a stranger offers you a deal too good to be true, avoid it (he’s probably the devil in disguise); if an animal asks you for help, give it (he’s probably a god in disguise); if you are a child, it is better to be pure of heart than clever or brave (though being clever and brave helps, too). Within these stories are the first things we learn about the importance of trust, but also of circumspection; of generosity, but also of thrift; of cooperation, but also of autonomy.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/29/t-magazine/travel-fairy-tale-issue.html

SPELL By Ann Lauterbach. (Penguin Poets, paper, $22.) The quicksilver elusiveness of language dances through Lauterbach’s 10th collection, which darts from pithy observation to clinical definition to a chatty ongoing conversation between the poet and evening. Fittingly, the book’s title refers variously to language and magic and the passage of time, as in “we’re having a spell of dark weather.” YOU DARLING THING By Monica Ferrell. (Four Way, paper, $15.95.) This lively, subversive book is fascinated by questions of feminism and femininity — womanhood as it is lived, and as it is socially constructed. In one poem a bride who takes scissors to her husband’s shirts explains: “That kind of violence is the other side of love.” FRUIT GEODE By Alicia Jo Rabins. (Augury, paper, $16.) The rewards and demands of pregnancy and young motherhood, emotionally and especially physically, anchor Rabins’s second collection. “I cannot think of my old ambition,” she writes in a blunt statement of maternal sacrifice, “before my nipples darkened.” THE POPOL VUH Translated by Michael Bazzett.

A witch, after all, is a woman with power. She has the ability to heal, satisfying wellness types who like to gift potions of hyssop and mugwort, anise seed and bladder wrack from Enchantments, a decades-old occult-themed shop in Manhattan’s East Village.
