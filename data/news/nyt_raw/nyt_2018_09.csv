2018-09-06,11 New Books We Recommend This Week,Suggested reading from critics and editors at The New York Times.,"Identity — whatever that even means — has been having a moment, lately. The political climate forces us all to decide grimly what bunker will welcome us, and the new culture wars spur people to define themselves before somebody else does it for them to possibly violent effect. Identity may be abstract and elusive, but that doesn’t mean it doesn’t have real-world consequences. So our recommended titles this week turn a spotlight on the subject, from Francis Fukuyama’s “Identity” to Kwame Anthony Appiah’s “The Lies That Bind” to two books about identity politics on college campuses: “The Splintering of the American Mind,” by William Egginton, and “The Coddling of the American Mind,” by Greg Lukianoff and Jonathan Haidt. (Those similar titles are no coincidence: Both books hark back to Allan Bloom’s classic “The Closing of the American Mind.”) We also have a book about the Spanish man who for decades falsely claimed to be a Holocaust survivor, and a joint biography of the mother and daughter who gave their names to the Myers-Briggs personality test. In other realms, there’s a biography of the tennis legend Arthur Ashe; new fiction from Gary Shteyngart, Ben Marcus and Tsitsi Dangarembga; and an essay collection about the role of the “dead girl” in popular culture, which posits that — in that case, anyway — the absence of identity is the whole point.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/06/books/review/11-new-books-we-recommend-this-week.html

2018-09-06,5 New Designers to Watch This Season,"Hailing from New York, London and Paris, these emerging talents will show their debut collections this month.","Growing up in upstate New York, Graham Tyler Baldwin was fascinated by art galleries. His parents organized family trips to the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., where the young art aficionado teared up the first time he saw a room full of pieces by Alexander Calder. Now 24, Baldwin will debut his first ready-to-wear collection during New York fashion week, inspired by his memories of these expeditions. “Spring 2019 is from the perspective of myself as a child, dreaming after an art museum visit,” Baldwin says. “The collection seeks to replicate that childhood experience of first encountering the color field paintings of Brice Marden and Ellsworth Kelly.” Baldwin originally studied sculpture at the Cleveland Institute of Art and landed an apprenticeship in 2013 with the milliner Marta Glazen. “I became interested in headwear as a form of intimate sculpture on the body,” he says. When he moved to New York City in 2015, he made custom headwear on his own for clients such as Lady Gaga, MAC and Barneys New York, and later for fashion brands such as Adam Selman and Polo Ralph Lauren. Making so many hats for so many labels, Baldwin wanted to finally create a brand under his vision. This coming collection, his first foray into ready-to-wear, will include a moiré evening vest based on a small drawing by Ellsworth Kelly, a silk organza trench coat and, of course, beautiful headwear to top it all off.

In addition to creating her sculptural, boundary-pushing fine jewelry — delicate rose-gold rings that span two fingers, diamond half-moon hoops that float above the earlobe — Khouri has become something of an amateur herbalist. “I am fascinated by how botanicals can cure or cause harm, depending on how they are used,” she said.

The new collection, which launches this weekend, retains the minimalist ’90s sensibility of the original line but features an updated fabric. Anoraks, padded jackets, quilted pants and bucket hats (there are also angular wraparound sunglasses) all come in a more technical, waterproof and windproof nylon, in a rainbow of new colors including highlighter pink, safety orange and bright mint green.

The Old Testament tale of Exodus — the slaves’ flight from Egypt and their salvation in the desert — may be the most epic of all such sagas, and the Puritans aboard the Mayflower thought of their flight from King James as an exodus of the chosen people fleeing their pharaoh. Ben Franklin’s best-selling “Autobiography” mythologized his rags-to-riches rise from indentured servant to inventor and statesman, and in so doing he further stitched the redemption narrative into the nation’s moral fabric. Since then, activists, politicians and businessmen have all borrowed the story line to lend legitimacy to their ambitions, but few have done so more powerfully than civil rights leaders: Martin Luther King Jr. insisted that Christians who had succumbed to bigotry could repent only by righting racial wrongs; Malcolm X recounted his transformation from hustler and felon to militant activist and Muslim, and in so doing, he invited a nation of sinners to follow him down the same spiritual path. In America, the resurrected wretch (“I once was lost but now am found”) has more authority than the pious innocent — to have fallen and been redeemed is an act of self-invention and moral fortitude that mirrors the Pilgrims’ own impossible journey.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/10/books/review/eli-saslow-rising-out-of-hatred.html

2018-09-13,How Sardinian Weaving Nearly Became a Lost Art,"There are some traditions that are universal. Here, we highlight a single craft — and how it’s being adapted, rethought and remade for the 21st century.","WHEN ISABELLA FRONGIA, 61, perhaps the most gifted weaver in Samugheo, the Sardinian town best known for its textiles, was a little girl, she would watch her mother, Susanna, work for hours at her loom. Located in the entry hall, the loom had been built of oak and chestnut by a local carpenter, and its squared edges had long ago gone smooth to the touch. Susanna, who is now 86, would sit before it, raising alternate strings attached to bamboo poles by pressing on the wooden pedals at her feet. She would send a bobbin of weft thread gliding across the horizontal surface of the remaining strings, strung taut in the loom’s belly, before yanking a heavy hinged wood batten with metal teeth toward herself, locking each new row into the others. This simple gesture — passing a weft thread through a base of stable warp threads — is the same for every piece of cloth ever woven. And on this loom, Susanna made everything the family needed, from bedcovers, blankets and towels to the wool textiles laid atop wood chests and the saddlebags slung over the backs of donkeys or men to transport things. Each piece was crafted according to designs and patterns stored in an unwritten repository of techniques and styles, many unique to the island, which over centuries had been passed through the hands of Sardinia’s women.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/13/t-magazine/sardinian-weaving-woven-textiles.html

As a preteen, she sprinkled protein powder on her Häagen-Dazs ice cream and she asked her mother to wrap her tuna fish sandwiches in seaweed instead of white bread. “My mom was like, ‘Okaaaay. Where did you come from?’ ” recalls Olshan. Now 31, her clean-living practices have stuck with her. As the founder of Fivestory — an uptown fashion boutique in a five-story townhouse known for its shoe “garden” and roster of rising designers — she installed a temporary wellness space on the fourth floor last year, filling it with offerings like vitamin-C skin boosters and raw-coconut-oil face highlighters. Her interest manifests not only in the merchandise. If a client should need an energy healer, breathing coach or Transcendental Meditation guru, Olshan has numbers for all three in her phone. Rather than gifting her V.I.P.s with baubles during the holidays, Olshan sends Sakara Life organic meal delivery plans. “I’m going to make you look gorgeous but feel good, too,” she says of her holistic intention.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/13/t-magazine/dada-daily-snacks-claire-olshan-fivestory.html

Considering his propensity for giving life, God would probably be a mother. Considering his appreciation of beauty (e.g., snowflake geometry) and busy schedule (e.g., Genesis), he would probably clothe himself in breezily tasteful garments made from natural fabrics cut for maneuverability, like a long denim jumper dress worn over a shirt of pure white cotton.

Thus began her obsession with late 20th-century pottery from Kutahya, a Turkish city known for a particularly colorful form of patterned earthenware that has been produced there since the 15th century. “They’re beautiful but not precious, and I actually use them — the vases for flowers, the bowls for olives and nuts,” says Weinrib, whose collection numbers about 30 pieces. “I like things that feel special but also serve a purpose.” An affinity for bold design and utility is also what defined Weinrib’s namesake line of home décor, a business she recently closed to focus on special collaborations, made-to-order fabrics, rugs and vintage finds she’ll sell at her eponymous Manhattan studio. In addition, she’s working with local artisans to create pillows, caftans and textiles that will be sold at Vanessa Branson’s Marrakesh hotel, El Fenn, later this year, and in the spring, she’ll release a collection of carpets she created with the late poet and artist Rene Ricard.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/20/t-magazine/madeline-weinrib-turkish-ceramics.html

2018-09-28,"Original, Handwritten Manuscripts of ‘The Picture of Dorian Gray’",An earlier version of Oscar Wilde’s controversial novel contains homoerotic undertones which he edited out for the final book.,"“He can write for none but outlawed noblemen and perverted telegraph boys,” one critic wrote of Oscar Wilde in The Scots Observer in July 1890, responding to the first serialization of “The Picture of Dorian Gray” in Lippincott’s Magazine. This was just one of “hundreds of entries of vituperation in the press when it came out,” Wilde’s grandson Merlin Holland recently told The Times, and Wilde spent the next year revising his aestheticist tale of a double life for publication in book form, removing certain homoerotic passages. A new book of Wilde’s handwritten manuscripts, THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY (SP Books, $250), grants readers unfiltered access to lines of pure, unadulterated affection that the author was compelled to omit if he ever wanted the story to become the literary success it did. “It is quite true that I have worshipped you with far more romance than a man should ever give to a friend,” the painter Basil tells Dorian in the magazine edition, but not the final novel. “Somehow I had never loved a woman. I suppose I never had time. … I quite admit that I adore you madly, extravagantly, absurdly.” Such sentences led Lippincott’s readers to deem this, in Holland’s words, “a disgusting, sodomitical novel.” (He added that the full text would later be used in court as “circumstantial proof that Wilde was homosexual” — a charge that sent him to prison.) Holland, who wrote the new book’s foreword, considers this “the urtext of ‘Dorian Gray,’” revealing raw passions the writer intended to evoke before the world was yet ready to read them. “He was standing up for his right as an artist to write about whatever he pleased,” Holland said of his grandfather. “He had the right to create the characters he wanted to create.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/28/books/review/picture-of-dorian-gray-oscar-wilde.html
