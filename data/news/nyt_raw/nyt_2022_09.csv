An avid collector of black-and-white photography, the singer has handpicked 50 Peter Hujar prints for an exhibition at San Francisco’s Fraenkel Gallery. Opening next week, “Peter Hujar curated by Elton John” showcases the photographer’s breadth of subjects, which range from seascapes to beefcake to pets. “I’d long wanted to invite a formidable guest curator to dig into Hujar’s work,” says Jeffrey Fraenkel, who’s represented the artist’s estate since the early 2000s. “I came up with about a half dozen names, mostly writers and visual artists, but the idea of Elton seemed unbeatable.” Besides the fact that John has acquired 15 works by Hujar since 2011, the union made emotional sense to Fraenkel. “Hujar’s work focused on the [queer] cultural scene, male erotica and other issues that overlap with Elton’s interests,” says Fraenkel. Hujar is perhaps best known for his images of members of the cultural vanguard of 1970s and ’80s New York — among them Fran Lebowitz, Susan Sontag and David Wojnarowicz, who was Hujar’s partner. John made a point of choosing some of the photographer’s less-seen portraits, including those variously depicting a young Stevie Wonder, a middle-aged Peggy Lee and the Warhol acolyte Jackie Curtis in her open casket. “The show doesn’t shy away from the tough pictures about illness or death, which are main components of Hujar’s work,” says Fraenkel. Hujar himself died of complications from AIDS in 1987. Fittingly, all proceeds from the show’s first two sales will go to the Elton John AIDS Foundation.

But since “Tin Can” is a hybrid of science fiction and body horror, consider this praise. The film begins with the news that an untreatable disease dubbed Coral is spreading uncontrollably, covering the afflicted in Cronenbergian growths that look like creepy white plastic grafted onto flesh. Just as the scientist Fret (Anna Hopkins, “The Expanse”) has a breakthrough in her search for a cure, she is knocked out and wakes up, after an indeterminate amount of time, hooked to various tubes in a small capsule. Shot almost entirely in punishing close-ups, the scene might trigger oppressive claustrophobia in some viewers. Not that the rest of the movie pulls away all that much. Smith complements the suffocating visuals with an elaborate sound design involving an anxiety-inducing assortment of squeaks, gurgles, moans, whispers, whimpers and clangs that make “Tin Can” well worth watching with headphones. Explanations are dispensed in a slow drip — the idea of rich people getting themselves put under until Coral can be controlled is all too credible — but the movie succeeds as a medical nightmare come to life.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/02/movies/science-fiction-movies-streaming.html

When the marionette spirals his head like a pinewood Linda Blair, his joints make a satisfying creak. But boy oh real boy, is the script by Zemeckis and Chris Weitz a lifeless chunk of wood.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/08/movies/pinocchio-review.html

First thing in the morning, while I’m still in bed, I spray Chantecaille rosewater all over to help myself wake up. Then I shower and use Leonor Greyl Shampooing Reviviscence — on my hair and on my body, too — then Christophe Robin’s Shade Variation Mask in Baby Blonde. I am so devoted to my colorist in New York, Sharon Dorram, so I do all I can to preserve her work. If I do a blowout at home, I’ll use Dyson’s Airwrap. After the shower, I apply our Bio Lifting Serum and Rose de Mai Cream. In the summer I follow that with our Anti-Aging Face Tint in sheer bronze, and in the winter I’ll use our Sheer Glow Rose Face Tint and Future Skin foundation in one of four tones depending on how much sun I’ve had. The tints give you a little bit of a highlight and make your skin look delicious. I use a number of eye products, including our Nano Gold Energizing Eye Serum and the Eye Cream from the same range. When it comes to makeup, one thing I have to have is a very good eye pencil — I’m partial to our Luster Glide in Earth or Olive Brocade, which is green with a little blue. And I have a myriad of lipsticks but, right now, I’m using a lip tint we launched this summer. It looks so natural and is really moisturizing. If I have been outside all day, I will sleep in our Gold Recovery Mask and, the next day, it’s like my skin has no memory of being in the sun. And if I’m going to be on television, I’ll do our Bio Lifting Mask to help with wrinkles. I’m a gardener and don’t get manicures, but my mother got me started using Dior’s Creme Abricot on my nails — that and Aesop’s Resurrection Aromatique Hand Balm. I get pedicures at Spa 27 in East Hampton and I do acupuncture in Amagansett with Sandra Foster. I love Arnican, too. If you have a bruise just use that little orange tube. Le Wild is my signature scent — it’s based on a wild gardenia found in a forest in Brazil and is really fresh but has a lot of energy. I feel that it represents my life in that all that I love is wild.

Thirteen centuries later, the Chinese scientist Su Song built a 40-foot-tall water-powered astronomical clock tower, and by the early Renaissance, many church congregations could keep track of the lunar path and of the orbits of the known planets (even if they did believe Earth occupied the center of the galaxy). Eventually, the feature appeared in complex German and English grandfather clocks and, in the 20th century, was shrunken down to fit in a wristwatch. Now, as part of its Luminor Due line, the Italian brand Panerai has introduced a celestial timepiece, a slimmer, more formal alternative to its usually muscular, oversize designs. The 38-millimeter Luna, which comes in several versions — including one with a mother-of-pearl dial and a cushion case made from the house’s trademark mix of gold with touches of copper and platinum — features a three-dimensional 24-karat moon set against a starry night sky.

2022-09-13,The Artist Making Sculptures From Scraps,Plus: the stateside rise of fermented tofu and more from T’s cultural compendium.,"Though a staple of Chinese and Taiwanese home cooking, fermented tofu, or furu, has never had the stateside appeal of other preserved soybean products, such as miso and gochujang. Made by soaking soybean curds in a brine of rice wine, water, salt and spices, furu (also romanized to “fuyu” and “doufuru”) is now being embraced by Asian American chefs who are finding clever ways to capitalize on its specific tang, mild sweetness and intense umami. At Bonnie’s, Calvin Eng’s Williamsburg palace of Cantonese American food, and Wenwen, Eric Sze’s playful Greenpoint Taiwanese spot — two of Brooklyn’s most popular new restaurants — menu showstoppers include, respectively, furu cacio e pepe mein and so-called B.D.S.M. (brined, deboned, soy milk) fried chicken with a furu-infused baste.

Then, as the viewer’s breath is inevitably caught in his or her chest, the hand reaches up with the palm-size three-fingered sloth, and the mother sloth reaches out with her unwieldy claws to gather the baby to herself, safe at last with its arms around her neck.

The festivities were presided over by Bartolomeo Scappi, a provocative chef who was known for comparing cooking to architecture, and for treating the tabletop as a stage for flamboyant displays that on this occasion included an intricately carved figure of Hercules with a lion, a palanquin-bearing elephant and a man astride a camel. Such opulence was not uncommon for the time, but what’s noteworthy is that these scenes were cast not in stone but in butter. Though food sculpture is thought to date to at least the second millennium B.C., this is the earliest recorded instance — in Scappi’s 800-page opus, “The Opera of Bartolomeo Scappi” (1570) — of butter sculpture being mentioned in a European cookbook.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/15/t-magazine/butter-sculpture.html

Instead, the designer has lent his eye for color and print to Orior, the Irish design studio and furniture manufacturer. “I’ve always loved creating work that toes the line between ostentatious and pragmatic,” he says. “I think there’s something really exciting about bringing that fantasy into the real world and seeing how people interpret it in their everyday lives.” This four-piece offering of distinctive chairs certainly delights in that tension: Rogers’s gradient dot print, which brightened street style this spring, highlights the joyful sweep of a wingback chair the designer chose for his own home, while a duo of graphic black-and-white prints originally paired on an evening gown bring a mod mood to a chair inspired by 1960s Scandinavian style. The collaboration is rooted in the mutual admiration between Rogers and Orior’s creative director, Ciaran McGuigan, who initially met at the Savannah College of Art and Design. “Orior remains a family- and friends-run company,” says McGuigan (his parents, Brian and Rosie McGuigan, founded the brand in 1979), “so it means everything to us to have partnered with Christopher in this way.” Bringing an additional facet of community is the fact that all proceeds from the collection will be donated directly to grass-roots organizations identified with the support of Color for Change, whose work uplifts and supports the Black community.

2022-09-15,A Fashion House Brings Out the Spray Paint Again,A new jacket and trousers from Alexander McQueen nod to the brand’s explosive runway finale decades earlier.,"In September 1998, the British fashion designer Alexander McQueen presented his spring 1999 women’s wear collection, a rumination on the relationship between man and machine, in a former London bus depot. The Paralympic athlete and double amputee Aimee Mullins appeared in the show wearing a pair of intricately hand-carved ash legs designed by McQueen, who also paraded his signature bumsters and cutaway coats through the dimly lit warehouse. For the finale, the model Shalom Harlow walked out in a papery muslin dress with a billowing underskirt of white tulle and a belted chest harness — and then stood on a revolving wooden turntable, like a music box figurine, between two ominous-looking mechanical robots shipped in from an Italian car factory. They engaged with her in an eerie, menacing dance, and then began shooting paint at her, covering her dress with black-and-neon yellow graffiti. Harlow, who trained as a ballet dancer in her youth, flailed her arms as she spun around. “And when they were finished,” she later recalled, “they sort of receded and I walked, almost staggered, up to the audience and splayed myself in front of them with complete abandon and surrender.” The performance — like “High Moon” (1991), the Rebecca Horn installation that inspired it, of two rotating guns shooting red liquid at each other — was provocative and operatic, exactly the kind of spectacle that made McQueen’s shows so exhilarating to watch.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/15/t-magazine/alexander-mcqueen-robot-paint-suit.html

2022-09-18,The Week in Business: Rail Strike Averted,Higher-than-expected inflation in August rattled financial markets. The Federal Reserve is expected to approve another big rate increase. But Social Security recipients have a reason to cheer.,"With less than 24 hours until a critical deadline for negotiations, the country’s largest rail companies reached a tentative agreement with labor unions representing some 115,000 workers early Thursday morning. An impasse in bargaining brought workers to the brink of a strike that could have started as soon as Friday, with far-reaching consequences for the already mangled supply chain as well as inflation and Amtrak service. The main sticking points had to do with scheduling and sick time: Labor groups were asking that workers be allowed to see a doctor or attend to a personal matter without risking disciplinary action. White House officials got involved in trying to bring the two sides to a deal both because of the economic impact of a work stoppage and the political impact on President Biden and his party before the midterm elections. Martin J. Walsh, the Labor secretary, helped broker the tentative agreement, which gives workers one additional paid day off and the ability to go to medical appointments without penalty, labor unions said. It still needs to be ratified by union members — a process that could take weeks — but workers have agreed not to strike while the votes are tallied.",Business Day,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/18/business/the-week-in-business-rail-strike.html

2022-09-19,An Italian Villa Where Architecture Is a Family Affair,"Most homes hold the history of their owners, but Il Palazzetto is as much a monument to its designers as to its inhabitants.","WHEN ALDO BUSINARO acquired Il Palazzetto in 1964, the proud Palladian-style villa outside Monselice, an ancient town a 30-minute drive south of Padua in northeast Italy, was all but unlivable. Purchased by Businaro’s grandfather in 1924, when it was already near derelict, the house was used for agricultural storage, its only residents farm tools, surplus grain and dormice for decades, except for a brief stint during World War II. Still, determined to transform it into a family home, Businaro uprooted his wife, Lucia, and their three sons from Padua, and moved in the following year. Federico, the middle child, now 58, remembers that initially they slept all together in the one room whose ceiling didn’t leak; Lucia cooked their meals on a camping stove. Built in 1627 for Francesco Giovanni Tassello, a prosperous doctor, Il Palazzetto stands at the center of a 50-acre estate of fertile farmland. An 8,600-square-foot cube with a red clay-tile roof and ivy-covered tan plaster facade, the house is a so-called minor villa, yet Tassello clearly had major ambitions: Above the trompe l’oeil columns and doorways that decorate the 20-foot-high walls of the salon on the second floor, a ribbon of frescoes depict scenes from Virgil’s “Aeneid.” But Tassello became ill with bubonic plague before he could finish the sweeping entrance he’d almost certainly planned for the house, which meant the villa the Businaros inherited was in disrepair and incomplete.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/19/t-magazine/il-palazzetto-italy-tobia-carlo-scarpa.html

Growing up in Barcelona, where he’s now based, the Spanish artist, 40, sewed toys from scraps of cloth. Later, he encountered soft works by Louise Bourgeois and Joseph Beuys and realized that sculpture didn’t have to be made from just stone or wood — it could be pliable. Later still, he was drawn to Greco-Roman statuary: busts and friezes and architectural reliefs. “But the process of working with stone is aggressive,” he says. “Textiles are sensitive; they absorb.

2022-09-21,A Gold Necklace Fit for a Pharaoh,Van Cleef & Arpels’s new collar embodies an ancient regality in its design.,"The gold collar is an ancient form of adornment; around the third millennium B.C., the Egyptian hieroglyph for the word “gold” itself took the form of a necklace that was bold, broad and suited for a pharaoh. Designers at the Parisian haute jeweler Van Cleef & Arpels, which has been headquartered in the same space on Place Vendôme since 1906, became fascinated with such antiquities after the British archaeologist Howard Carter unearthed King Tutankhamen’s tomb in 1922. In the years since, the house has produced many Egyptian revival works, including 1947’s thick gold Wave necklace punctuated with small diamonds. This newest homage, featuring an asymmetrical spray of stones that seem to defy gravity as they cling to the necklace’s convex surface, is made with a proprietary tool developed in the 1960s to create a textured relief on each articulated section. While modern techniques may render a monumental piece of this nature both more delicate and more comfortable to wear than those the pharaohs coveted, the impression remains one of supreme elegance.

The plan had been for the presentation to take place in the Ramble, a section of Central Park as famous for cruising as for bird-watching; the Georgian fashion designer had been thinking about the exchange of desire and his own complicity in such transactions.

The result is an exuberant debut collection of furniture that includes a desk bearing a sculpted hand; a sofa covered with polka-dot ring- and pretzel-shaped pottery and upholstered in ethically sourced alpaca fur; and a coral-inspired vase with protruding eyeballs. While she’s no longer solely focused on producing metal cuffs and rings, Miro wants her furniture to feel every bit as precious as her jewelry. “If you can have one thing and you love art,” she says, “well, maybe that thing is also a desk. So now you have art and a desk.” — Gillian Brassil",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/22/t-magazine/italian-rainbow-cookie.html

Mr. Seetoh selected them all. “There had to be a cross-section of Chinese, Indonesian, Malay, Nonya, Filipino and Singapore stalls,” he said. There is even what Mr. Seetoh calls “Singapore-Western food,” like the curries sold at a spot called Smokin Joe. A few stalls, like Lady Wong for Indonesian sweets, are based in New York. There are also several halal vendors, Mamak’s Corner with Indian noodles, and Padi d’NYC for Singapore Malaysian fare. A big bar anchors the 51st Street end of the market. A highlight, Mr. Seetoh said, is Wok & Staple from Dragon Phoenix in Singapore, said to have originated chile crab. “It’s all fast but not fast food,” he said. “It’s made to order.

As we meandered, I joked that I felt as if I were in the Garden of Eden, and I asked her if she ever felt like God. “Well, yeah,” she responded matter-of-factly, “but I’ve played God so often that it’s sort of understandable that I would.” ",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/28/magazine/whoopi-goldberg.html

Once they had a child, they moved into a post-and-beam midcentury “tree fort,” as the pair called it, with a hollow barn door that separated the living space from their baby’s room, preventing them from ever throwing dinner parties. So in 2019, when they purchased a 1950s ranch-style property in the Eastside neighborhood of Eagle Rock, the “first goal,” says Breer, who was pregnant with her second child during the renovation, “was to get our kids’ bedrooms as far away as possible so that we can live our lives at night.”",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/28/t-magazine/sally-breer-los-angeles-home.html

2022-09-28,Gaetano Pesce Still Has His Eye on the Horizon,The designer’s new resin screen is a sign of his enduring fascination with the Manhattan skyline.,"A critic once described the work of the designer Gaetano Pesce, who has practiced for more than 60 years, as the “architectural equivalent of a brainstorm.” Even now, at 82, the Italian-born, New York-based polymath continues to rage with the force of a Technicolor tornado. Among his recent objects is this resin triptych screen, an abstract depiction of Manhattan’s high-rises with a fiery red sun on the horizon. Like much of Pesce’s work, which often combines spiky sociopolitical commentary with Dadaesque brio, the room divider is audacious, colorful and definitely not minimalist. It’s a companion piece to his blobby 1980 Tramonto a New York sofa, which evokes the titular metropolis with foam-filled armrests as skyscrapers and a stuffed scarlet sun backrest. At the time he made it, he was concerned that the city had lost its ability to inspire, roiled as it was by recession and crime. In resurfacing the skyline motif, Pesce strikes a hopeful note, reminding us that misery tends to be transitory. “I thought of the screen as not only functional but also an expression of positivity and optimism for a better world in the future,” he says.

Officially, the sanctuary — home to snow leopards and what may be the last couple of hundred hanguls (Kashmir stags) in the world — is closed when night falls. But over two years of foraging, Sadhu had earned the respect of the rangers, and one of them had spotted the bears and led us toward them for a closer look, warning us to stay together. When a twig cracked underfoot, he put a finger to his lips. Later, I would learn that the Himalayan black bear is among the most savage of its genus, prone to unprovoked attacks and fond of grasping humans by the head.

From a scarlet Orientalist pagoda for a Cotswolds estate to an Arthurian pavilion in shades of persimmon and amber beside a villa in St.-Tropez, the room-size enclosures can take weeks to make in his 14-person studio. With bold stripes and saturated colors (“I find white too aggressive,” he says), they evoke the swagged salons of the iconic designer Renzo Mongiardino and the sun-bleached colonial-era idylls conjured by the British novelist E.M. Forster. Despite their minimalist materials — canvas, rope, iron and bamboo — the designs suggest maximalist eras of the past; Toschi, 60, calls them “an invitation to dream.”",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/29/t-magazine/guido-toschi-turin-design.html

Elling’s article argued that drug companies were missing an opportunity by not tracking how often individual physicians were prescribing certain drugs. By aggregating such data, pharmaceutical salespeople could target their marketing pitches to the doctors most likely to become heavy prescribers, and the sales reps themselves could also be better evaluated by their companies. Soon enough, a relatively unknown drug company called Purdue Pharma came calling, retaining McKinsey in 2004 to help increase sales of its opioid pain killer OxyContin — which had already topped $1 billion annually. In the face of a worsening national opioid addiction crisis and multiple state and federal investigations, prescriptions of higher-strength OxyContin pills had begun to level off. Among other recommendations, McKinsey, led by Elling and his team, suggested “turbocharging” sales through more innovative and aggressive marketing tactics. Between 2004 and 2019, Purdue paid McKinsey $83.7 million in fees.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/29/books/review/when-mckinsey-comes-to-town-walt-bogdanich-michael-forsythe.html

Refined yet durable, the interlocking motif came to signify discreet luxury. In 2001, when the German designer Tomas Maier arrived as the brand’s creative director, the fashion industry was at the height of It bag mania and the accompanying obsession with monograms, flashy hardware and other embellishments. But Maier was determined to protect Bottega’s bags from trends. Shortly after his appointment, he came across a rounded box clutch circa 1978 in the archives and decided to make it his own, swapping out its rectangular clasp for one shaped like a nautical rope and naming the curvy pochette Knot. Since spring 2002, most seasons have included iterations of the clutch, which has been reimagined in an array of materials, colors and sizes.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/29/t-magazine/bottega-veneta-knot-clutch.html

2022-09-30,Two-Tone Watches That Leave the Past Behind,These timepieces shake off their clichéd 1980s associations.,"It might seem hard to bring the two-tone watch back into fashion when its most famous model is Patrick Bateman, the titular “American Psycho” of Bret Easton Ellis’s 1991 novel. In Mary Harron’s darkly comic 2000 film adaptation, the serial killer and investment banker, played by Christian Bale, treasures and flaunts his dual metal timepiece — another detail in the twisted satirical portrayal of 1980s yuppie culture. The film perhaps clinched the association between the two-tone wristwatch and the decadence and materialism of the era — Richard Gere also wore one to play a corporate raider in “Pretty Woman” (1990) — but now, decades on, the accessory has re-emerged with designs that are a reminder of the style’s playful and subtle possibilities. The Tag Heuer Aquaracer, pictured above, employs different lusters: The lush steel case sets off the brilliant glow of its yellow-gold bezel, and the sun-brushed watch face catches light in fine blue shades. The Bell & Ross BR 05, shown here in black steel and gold, has the brand’s signature silhouette — a circular dial on a rounded square — but in this iteration, the contrast between the charcoal, rose and silver sheens grants it a bold sophistication.

In any case, the ‘80s, in this movie’s conception, are nothing more than a nebulous composite of vaguely evocative signifiers: big hairdos, fluorescent tracksuits, Trapper Keepers, and an old hit by Tiffany or Rockwell on the soundtrack every few minutes.

2022-09-30,Five Science Fiction Movies to Stream Now,Amnesiacs and French-history time travelers are among the protagonists in this month’s sci-fi picks.,"The movie “Butt Boy” was fairly divisive when it came out a couple of years ago, but the least you can say is that the director Tyler Cornack fully committed to the story of a man who becomes obsessed with — let’s just say the title was pretty descriptive. Now Cornack is confirming the warped singularity of his vision with “Tiny Cinema,” an anthology of six stand-alone shorts that straddle the line between sci-fi, horror and comedy. (The movie derived from the Tiny Cinema videos Cornack has been posting online.) What links the chapters, as they are called, is the sense that the characters are stuck in nightmares that have their own comically horrific — or horrifically comic — absurdist logic. A common setup is to take a word or an expression literally and see what happens, as in “Game Night,” where Bert (Austin Lewis) becomes obsessed with the sentence “That’s what she said,” and the chapter with an unprintable title referring to a common insult. Few movies have described some single people’s desperation to find their soul mate as economically as “Edna,” in which the title character (Olivia Herman) starts dating a corpse she found floating in a river. Despite its tight duration, “Edna” even manages a hilarious second act. Cornack balances storytelling economy with an expansive approach — a rare feat.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/30/movies/science-fiction-movies-streaming.html
