A particular method, for lack of a better word, thrived in the late 19th and early 20th centuries — targeted efforts by white mobs to violently destroy Black communities. In 1919, there were so many attacks between May and August alone that the writer James Weldon Johnson termed it “The Red Summer.” In 1923, the community of Rosewood, Fla., was razed; and the list goes on, with far too many such tragedies to cite here. But since 2019’s HBO hit “Watchmen,” only one of these massacres has become a cultural shorthand: the Tulsa massacre of 1921, in which thousands of white people stormed the city’s Greenwood district and burned it to the ground, killing an estimated 300 African Americans and leaving thousands homeless.

I happened to live in these parts for three years, and I crossed the overpass twice a day most days.

The owners, Maguy Le Coze and the chef, Eric Ripert, have planned a dinner to mark the occasion. Ms. Le Coze and her brother, Gilbert, first opened their seafood restaurant in 1972 on the Left Bank in Paris, with a view of Notre Dame, then relocated the restaurant near the Arc de Triomphe. They made the trans-Atlantic move to the present location in New York in 1986, as an anchor in a collection of restaurants in a new office tower on Seventh Avenue. The restaurant received four stars in its first New York Times review, three months after opening, a top ranking it has maintained over decades. In Paris it received two stars from Michelin, but was never awarded the ultimate three. (Mr. Le Coze contended that it was because they only served fish.) When Michelin introduced its New York guide in 2005, the restaurant finally achieved the third star. It was a pinnacle that Mr. Le Coze was unable to enjoy: He died unexpectedly of a heart attack in 1994. Ms. Le Coze kept the restaurant going with Mr. Ripert, who became her partner in the restaurant. To mark the anniversary they have organized a $1,000 per person six-course dinner on Wednesday with 10 percent going to the charity City Harvest, which Mr. Ripert supports. The menu combines echoes of Le Bernardin classics, like the pounded tuna first course; and monkfish with a sunchoke purée replacing melted leeks. (Mr. Le Coze is often credited with popularizing monkfish for the American audience.) In recent years, Le Bernardin has always been at or near the top of global restaurant awards.",Food,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/07/dining/le-bernardin-anniversary.html

2022-11-08,A Parisian Brasserie With a Global Footprint Sets Up Shop in TriBeCa,"A Ukrainian restaurant in the former Pegu Club space, a new look for the restaurant in Scandinavia House and more news.","Desbrosses Street in TriBeCa is not exactly the Champs-Élysées, but it’s a fairly broad boulevard. So it’s still an appropriate home base for this venerable Paris brasserie, now with a global presence. It’s managed by Groupe Barrière, whose hotels often house a Fouquet’s. Built into the Hotel Barrière Fouquet’s New York, the ground-floor brasserie is brightly elegant, done with Art Deco details, glittering chandeliers, red leather upholstery, brass trim and white tablecloths. Pierre Gagnaire, whose work at Saint-Étienne in Paris has earned him three Michelin stars, is supervising the menu. The executive chef, Bradley Stellings, who worked with Alain Ducasse and his second-in-command, Didier Elena, said that Mr. Gagnaire’s signature, typically a refreshing touch of citrus, could be found in a number of traditional dishes, even the French onion soup. Count on oysters, escargots, caviar service, lobster fricassee, chicken paillard, a salmon casserole with Champagne, and, for dessert, the signature mille-feuille and profiteroles. Sharing the hotel lobby is Par Ici Cafe, for more casual Mediterranean fare in an indoor-outdoor setting with a garden. There are also several bars throughout.

Asch, who moved her New York-based studio, Brrch, to Los Angeles in late 2020 and has used the flower in her dreamy, lyrical arrangements, says that because florists in, say, Miami or Hawaii have better access to tropical hibiscuses than their counterparts in New York, this creates an “element of exclusivity” — compounded, perhaps, by the brief life of the blossoms — that renders them even more desirable.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/11/t-magazine/hibiscus-flowers.html

It was probably in the midst of “Rich Wigga, Poor Wigga” the episode in which high school kids, in order to qualify for a college scholarship that a wealthy Black man is giving out, have to take a test to prove their Blackness. Black people love to talk about what’s Blacker than what or who’s Blacker than who because, for many of us, Blackness is more than an ethnicity; it’s a religion we love to praise. “Atlanta” took the notion of a racial test to the nth degree, in a way that was funny but also loving.

As its name predicted, L.F. was lost and found and lost and found. Over and over. Each time it returned, L.F. was a little more worn. A stain on the back of its neck in the shape of a star appeared. Its soft pompom tail shrunk to half its size like a melting snowball. The scratched plastic eyes deepened and grew wise; the left eye loosened and eventually fell off. When Noah first told me L.F.’s name, I thought he’d said “Alef,” like the first letter of the Hebrew alphabet. I thought he’d named it after an ancient scratch, the beginning of something that has, as far as we know, no end. The last time I remember seeing L.F., he was more story than bunny, more memory than animal: the well-loved thing knocked, and snipped, and cracked, and thinned enough for new light to shine through. It is new stuffing in old skin. The fractured fairy tale is a bunny called Lost and Found with one original eye and one brown button to replace what once fell off and disappeared.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/11/books/review/kids-fairy-tales.html

Likewise, Ayurvedic practitioners in India have long prescribed massaging the head with oil, a practice that British colonists eventually brought back to England. Harking back to these treatments, a new crop of products — featuring some technological advancements and updated ingredients — has emerged, with an eye toward if not restoring lost locks, then at least supporting growth by affording the scalp the same care and attention we give to the rest of our skin.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/15/t-magazine/scalp-health-serums-exfoliators.html

Oliverea Valley’s 30 accommodations — a mix of free-standing A-frame cabins and stylish guest rooms in a central building — mark the first time the brand, which also operates hotels in Windham and Lake Placid, has “started from scratch,” says Boyer.

2022-11-21,"In Morocco, a Hotel That Offers the Luxury of Peace and Quiet",The newly opened Olinto is a serene escape in the foothills of the Atlas Mountains.,"In the early ’90s, Fabrizio Ruspoli di Poggio Suasa, a French Italian aristocrat from Paris and a former dealer in 18th-century French furniture, moved to Marrakesh. Ruspoli, who grew up visiting his grandmother in Morocco, quickly felt at home among the city’s well-known expats — among them at the time the interior designer Bill Willis, the fashion designer Yves Saint Laurent and his partner, Pierre Bergé — and soon purchased the popular French restaurant La Maison Arabe, transforming it into the medina’s first riad hotel. But in the three decades since his arrival, says Ruspoli, Marrakesh has, for better and worse, grown “along with the noise of scooters.” So three years ago, he decided to sell the hotel to seek a quieter life about an hour’s drive outside of town in the Atlas Mountains. But not too quiet: This fall, Ruspoli and his longtime partner, José Abete, opened a new property, Olinto, in the lush Ouirgane Valley. Set on 10 acres planted with olive groves and fragrant gardens, the hotel has dramatic views of the red earth mountains, with nine vine-covered guesthouses with rooftop sitting areas, private gardens and, in some cases, pools. A spa will open sometime next year, but for now, guests can lounge on the many wisteria-lined terraces and enjoy massages in the traditional hammam. Ruspoli, who says he was “born playing a piano,” named his new project in honor of his like-minded ancestor Marquis Francesco Maria Ruspoli, a patron of Handel, who adopted the moniker Olinto, after a village in ancient Greece, as part of his membership in a musical and literary society called the Academy of Arcadia. “My hope is to host something similar here: a retreat and, eventually, a small music festival surrounded by my gardens,” he says.

From the top of the gently sloped 6.3-acre lot, they would follow a wide brick path under a canopy of native chicalá and guayacán trees to its end at a solitary brick lintel hung with dangling ferns.

In the second patio, they would climb a staircase that spread to a roofscape of catwalks and barrel vaults, eventually descending to the final terrace and out again into the garden that Salmona and Madriñán, now 67, had spent more than a decade planting before they laid the house’s first brick.

2022-11-23,Poem: Diaspora Sonnet Traveling Between Apartment Rentals,This poem’s final turn tightly encapsulates the immigrant experience with new language and destinations.,"Oliver de la Paz’s poem is part of a series of “diaspora sonnets,” in which this one, along with others, create a whole, while each sonnet can still operate on its own.

The poem comes to life in the fourth stanza when it becomes surreal, when the “blight in the siding” speaks. The final volta tightly encapsulates the immigrant experience — that of new grammar and new lands that are both alluring and tenuous.

I made a request for a Black mentee, but I was paired with a white woman. Now I’m second-guessing participating in the program. Black attorneys make up less than 5 percent of all attorneys and continue to face horrific experiences in law school and in the legal community. This is whom I envisioned myself supporting when I registered for the program as a recent graduate. I imagined deep conversations about law professors and law-firm culture, and sharing how I’ve learned to navigate them as a Black woman. Not only will these conversations not apply to my mentee the same way, but I can’t help wondering if assisting them will ultimately contribute to my own oppression. There are so many factors in her favor that I don’t really want to help give her even more of a leg up in my free time. On the other hand, I don’t have anything against her, and law school is universally scary during the first year. Should I be thinking about this differently? Is it wrong to bow out?

After completing his degree in industrial design at the Media and Design Academy in Genk and following a stint as a runway model for the fashion designer Raf Simons (who had also studied in Genk), Verheyden, now 44, began making handbags from a studio in his hometown. In 2007, he moved into a 1,600-square-foot townhouse in the center of the city with his wife, Saartje Vereecke, 46; together, they established a design firm under his name that sells objects like precisely tailored leather place mats and minimalist furnishings such as solid oak stools.

His father, a dentist, had an office on the first floor of the six-story early 18th-century building, where he would tend to the neighborhood’s eclectic residents. “Some of them went to see the dentist after visiting Serge Gainsbourg,” Rauzy recalls, referring to his family’s onetime neighbor, the famed pop provocateur, “so of course they were full of whiskey!” Decades later, the area is known for its clothing boutiques and galleries.
