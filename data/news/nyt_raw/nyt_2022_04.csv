He chops one down and carries it back to the clearing. He repeats this action until he has assembled a pile of timber. We watch as he demolishes his old, thatched workshop and builds a new one, twice the size. The man does not explain what he is doing as he frames the structure or as he thatches the roof with palm fronds and vines; in fact, he doesn’t talk at all. If you turn on the closed captioning, you can see descriptions of his actions, but only very general ones: “lashing rafters,” “putting rafters in place,” etc. There is no music. There’s no extradiegetic sound at all — just the forest’s chirping melodies and the rustling and chopping and hammering of insects, birds, wind in leaves, stone on wood.

Maybe this is because they don’t know how billionaires affect their lives or what political power they wield; maybe it’s just because a billion is such an unfathomably large number. A decade or so ago, three political scientists at Northwestern University, Benjamin Page, Jason Seawright and Matthew Lacombe, set out to determine the impact that superrich Americans have on congressional and presidential policies. They weren’t starting from scratch; previous work done by another political scientist, Martin Gilens, used years of surveys of thousands of poor, middle-income and affluent Americans to show that policymakers responded almost exclusively to the preferences of that last group. Following this earlier research, Page told me recently, “I wanted to find out how much influence the truly wealthy have and what they want from government.” Page and his colleagues wanted to do a quantitative analysis of political inequality. First, however, they had to figure out where to get the data.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/06/magazine/billionaire-politics.html

It’s quite possible Forbes saw something of himself in Astor. This was a different era of magazine publishing; Forbes — who wound up making the cut on his own list — lived like a sultan. He entertained celebrities and politicians on a 126-foot yacht called the Highlander. By the end of his run he owned a chateau in Normandy, 12 Fabergé eggs and a collection of hot-air balloons in fantastical designs — one shaped like the Sphinx, one like a bust of Beethoven, one like a Fabergé egg, one like the chateau in Normandy and, of course, one in the image of a sultan, about as tall as his yacht was long.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/07/magazine/billionaires.html

Ron DeSantis signing Florida’s so-called Don’t Say Gay bill to Gov. Greg Abbott issuing a Texas directive that would classify medical care for transgender adolescents as “child abuse,” Republicans across the country seem to be doubling down on anti-L.G.B.T.Q. policies.

His “Angels in America” hit two-part play examined the AIDS epidemic and L.G.B.T.Q. life in the United States.

This was not our country: We had only just arrived, and the celebrations had not included us. We didn’t mind, having paid the price of inclusion earlier in our lives. In fact our feelings had become more or less irrelevant, without our entirely noticing.

Researchers, the study noted, are increasingly using magnetic resonance imaging — which can reveal the brain’s structure and activity — to try to find links between what is seen on an M.R.I., like cortical thickness or patterns of connection, and complicated psychological traits, like cognitive ability or mental-health conditions. In theory, such so-called brain-wide association studies could yield incredibly valuable insights. Knowing that a particular neurological feature makes someone more vulnerable to autism, Alzheimer’s or another disorder, for example, could help predict, prevent or treat that condition.

The “Roots” mini-series, watched by millions (all at the same time, in a way that’s probably hard to imagine for those too young to remember life before D.V.R.s), portrayed the trans-Atlantic slave trade and plantation barbarity in a way American audiences hadn’t seen. As Charlayne Hunter-Gault reported for The Times in 1977, a Black economist in Philadelphia said, “It has made the brutality of slavery more vivid for me than anything I’ve seen or read.” To refresh a sense of what an event “Roots” was at the time, recall that the cast included some of the biggest names of the day, including John Amos, Lloyd Bridges and Sandy Duncan.

His book All the Queens Houses: An Architectural Portrait of New York’s Largest and Most Diverse Borough (Jovis, $22.99, 272 pp.) documents how Queens subdivision dwellers vie for attention with aqua awnings, watermelon stucco pigments and driveways patterned in sine waves. Simulated cracks slash across brickwork on townhouse chimney stacks, and mansards seem to be melting. He gently chides a “dead cat” crevice between homes that would be “impossible to clean” and a balcony on spindly stilts that has “the smooth surfaces and floating quality of a hydraulic car lift.” But he largely avoids judgment while devising formal titles for dwellings like Pixel Ghost, Cerulean Icebox, Minoan Makeover and Samurai Helmet House.",Style,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/21/style/new-design-books.html

Even though I’m still figuring out what my life’s going to look like here, I’ve already noticed a shift in my artistic practice.

2022-04-21,Poem: Going Going Gone,A surreal depiction of grief that shows how it can change within stasis. ,"This poem in translation is surreal in its depiction of grief. It has a recurring image of a bird that’s a figure for death and grief after the loss of the poet’s father. Don Mee Choi’s translation of the poem captures the eternal void of grief. Repetition mimics grief’s insistence: “Bird cuts me out” in the first and third stanzas, “I exit” throughout and “I take a step toward where I don’t exist,” which is repeated twice near the end of the poem. The poem’s form shows how grief changes within stasis. The second and fourth stanzas echo but swerve, until we get the callback and negation in the final stanza: “Bird doesn’t cut me out.” The final line, “Behind the wall I’m on standby forever,” channels the energy of a lyric poem, a sense of running in place.

I couldn’t get my mom’s hopes up like that. So I just didn’t tell anybody. The only person who knew was Liz Caplan, who’s been my voice teacher for nearly a decade. Beginning in September, we started working together on this show twice a week, mostly over FaceTime.

As a painter, I hoped to be able to add something to the larger lexicon and say, “OK, I contributed a new way of making a painting.” Maybe it’s an ego thing, but I felt like I had to create some kind of formal aspect that was entirely unique to me and my studio practice so that someone could look at a piece and say, “Oh, that’s a Tschabalala painting.” When I was in grad school at Yale, I focused primarily on printmaking. And I’d gotten a lot of success out of that, but there were also limitations. That’s how I started sewing fabric directly onto the canvas.

It was all about speed, touch, timing. It’s difficult to be precise. When I first started doing these one-brushstroke paintings, if I didn’t like what I’d done, I’d get down on my hands and knees with a can of mineral spirits and a bunch of rags and wipe it off. By the time I’d finished that, I’d lost the kind of muscle memory of what I was trying to do.

The production was meant to be put on at the Public Theater in New York in the spring of 2020, but Covid-19 intervened. We left the theater and our stuff, thinking, like so many others, that we’d be back soon. It was an odd thing to happen in the middle of a show about displaced people.

Rather than focus on grand gestures, the idea was to instead highlight the seemingly mundane activities that some of our greatest artists either incorporate into their creative processes — or pursue in order to let their minds empty and drift. “I told our photographers that this issue is about private, internal moments,” says Nadia Vellam, T’s photography and video director. “I wanted the portraits to be cinematic and voyeuristic, and to focus on someone in a moment of personal expression or contemplation.” Collectively, the images provide windows into the subjects’ daily routines: the choreographer Raja Feather Kelly waiting for the F train, the conceptual artist Rirkrit Tiravanija cooking pad Thai and the actor Ethan Hawke walking his dogs (“They were incredibly well behaved,” Vellam notes).",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/21/t-magazine/culture-issue-behind-the-scenes.html

My mom’s side of the family was always by the sea, and I guess I’ve inherited that gene. These cold water swims are a recent thing, though. I like outdoor activities that’re bracing and stimulating: Being against, and leaning into, the elements has always been quite rewarding and meditative.

2022-04-21,Deborah Birx’s Excruciating Story of Donald Trump’s Covid Response,"“Silent Invasion,” an insider’s look at the Trump administration’s pandemic policies, is earnest and exhaustive, our reviewer says.","On March 2, 2020, Dr. Deborah Birx took up her new position as coronavirus response coordinator within the White House Coronavirus Task Force. She was fresh off a plane from South Africa, where she had been busy in her sixth year as the global AIDS coordinator for the United States, overseeing the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), a well-regarded and efficacious initiative begun by George W. Bush. The word “coordinator” is an equivocal title under the best of bureaucratic circumstances, let alone in the Trump White House, and amid the urgency of this new pandemic, arising to occlude the older one (AIDS), Birx had no time or opportunity to define the title before assuming it. She had said yes to “a job I didn’t seek but felt compelled to accept,” she recounts in “Silent Invasion.” She wasn’t the chair of this White House task force; Alex Azar, the secretary of Health and Human Services, held that position until he was replaced after one month by Vice President Pence. Birx had an office in the West Wing but almost no staff, and her only leverage was persuasion. Her account of how that played out — it’s no spoiler to say, how poorly that played out — is earnest, exhaustive and excruciating.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/21/books/review/deborah-birx-silent-invasion-trump-covid.html
