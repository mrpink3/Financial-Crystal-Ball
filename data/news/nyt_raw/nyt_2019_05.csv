2019-05-02,10 New Books We Recommend This Week,Suggested reading from critics and editors at The New York Times.,"Before April recedes too far into the rearview, let’s pause a moment to appreciate a month that gave us cause — as if we needed it — to celebrate both earth and verse. Whether you wanted a book for Earth Day (April 22) or for National Poetry Month (the whole darn month), Brian Teare’s “Doomstead Days” might have served: A collection of poems composed while walking, it honors and mourns the changing landscapes it encounters throughout. If that whets your appetite for more poetry, you should definitely read Morgan Parker’s “Magical Negro,” which cements her place as one of the smartest, liveliest, most accomplished young poets working today. Or if it fires you up to read more about the environment and what we’re doing to it, Nathaniel Rich’s “Losing Earth: A Climate History” (which started as an article for The Times Magazine) spins a bleak and gripping narrative about how we’ve reached this point. SMH, as the kids say online. That’s short for “shaking my head,” but in my house we thought for a long time it meant “so much hate.” In this case, both meanings apply.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/02/books/review/10-new-books-we-recommend-this-week.html

The boys could hear boulders tumbling down the cliffs behind them, so they crawled toward the ocean to avoid being crushed. “We looked up,” Allen says, “and it was just this wall of water coming at us.”",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/07/magazine/how-to-survive-a-tsunami.html

You’ve seen it yourself, how it goes slack jawed and gooey in Steven Spielberg’s “Jurassic Park” or opens screaming like the jaws of hell while she plays three — or is it four? — characters in David Lynch’s epic of psychic disintegration, “Inland Empire.” Or recall the three-minute breakdown that begins the pilot episode of the 2011 HBO series “Enlightened.” Dern lifts her head — she’s crying in a bathroom stall at work, having just been demoted for sleeping with the boss — and her mouth does that determined, wrenching thing only Laura Dern’s mouth can do, stretching flat like a rubber band, exposing her bottom teeth on just the right side. The mascara drips under her eyes, the lines on her forehead pop, and as two women gossip about her at the sink, the expression morphs into a grimace that carries her on a frantic rage storm through the office. Her eyes do 100 tiny calculations at once, her mouth flipping up and down and finally opening wide, wider than it should be physically possible to make a mouth, mirroring the elevator doors that she drags apart with her bare hands.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/07/magazine/laura-dern-little-women.html

In the case of this recently completed elaborate collar by the Paris-based Cartier, that expedition began and ended at the annual gem show in Tucson, Ariz. While there are other such trade events throughout the world — Hong Kong, Basel, Switzerland, and Las Vegas also host prominent events — the Tucson show is the most idiosyncratic, with dealers bringing crystals, minerals and fossils in addition to precious and semiprecious stones. The six-person Cartier team spotted the more-than-15-carat octagonal yellow sapphire at a booth on the first day and a few hours later connected with a dealer who had a cache of brilliant blue lapis lazuli beads. Though purchases from a particular trip don’t always end up in the same piece, in this instance, the jewelers were struck by how the contrasting hues of pale orangy-yellow and intense cobalt might work together, echoing past Cartier collections that paired blue stones with gold.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/14/t-magazine/cartier-necklace-making-of.html

Catholicism forbade cremation, and crypts were already a public-health nightmare, so the only place to go was down. Burials within city limits were finally banned in 1780, after two decades of attempts. In 1785, the effort to remove human remains from graveyards and transfer them to underground tunnels was made law.

Here’s what studies show.,"Humans have been drinking fermented concoctions since the beginning of recorded time. But despite that long relationship with alcohol, we still don’t know what exactly the molecule does to our brains to create a feeling of intoxication.

Last September, the prestigious peer-reviewed British medical journal The Lancet published a study that is thought to be the most comprehensive global analysis of the risks of alcohol consumption. Its conclusion, which the media widely reported, sounded unequivocal: “The safest level of drinking is none.”",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/16/magazine/how-much-alcohol-can-you-drink-safe-health.html

Every destination offers its own appealing reasons for visiting — from its food to its people, from its cities to its historical sites — and there are always the more practical concerns that weigh down any traveler (costs, visas, seasons, flight routes, internet access). But the 21st-century traveler is more knowledgeable than ever before — she must engage in the ethics of where she visits, and why. Global conflicts are not new, but in a shrunken world, we hear of them much more quickly and in much more detail than we would have a generation ago. This means that even the casual traveler also faces an ethical dilemma when she chooses where to visit. What about a country’s treatment of minorities? What about its freedom of speech or the transparency of its government? And if we do go to a country ruled by a despot or military junta, will our currency benefit the nation’s citizens or only the regime that oppresses them? While there are few widely agreed upon rules for answering these questions, asking them seems increasingly vital. Here, seven travel writers contemplate the ethical ambiguities of travel.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/16/t-magazine/ethical-travel-reporting.html

2019-05-20,An Olive Oil From South Africa,Morgenster extra-virgin olive oil is made on a wine estate on the Cape.,"STELLENBOSCH, South Africa — For fine olive oil, South Africa does not readily come to mind. But the Mediterranean climate of the Cape wine region is excellent for olive trees, as Giulio Bertrand, an Italian who settled in Stellenbosch in the 1990s, discovered. Today it is estimated that the original plot — “the mother block” of trees on his estate, Morgenster — has provided millions of olive trees to growers in Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe, essentially kick-starting olive oil production throughout Southern Africa. Now, there are about 20 brands of extra-virgin olive oil in South Africa. Mr. Bertrand died last year at 91, but his daughters, Federica and Alessandra Bertrand, continue to run the estate, which has 30,000 trees and also produces wines. And the olive oils are perennial prizewinners. The 2018 bottling was ranked among the best in the world by Flos Olei, an olive oil guidebook. The 2018 oil is the estate’s flagship blend of 14 varietals, each picked and pressed separately before being combined. The extra-virgin oil is richly herbaceous on the palate, with notes of pepper and pleasing bitterness.",Food,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/20/dining/south-african-olive-oil.html

Slather asparagus with miso for grilling. Make a “bouillabaisse” with fennel, potatoes, tomatoes and rouille but no fish. A “poke” bowl features beets instead of tuna.

This became clear to Franz when his teachers in Berlin cast stealthily malicious glances at him when Jewish characters — such as Shylock in “The Merchant of Venice” — came up in literature. “Eh, Michalski, this exactly pertains to you,” he recalls one teacher telling him through a clenched smile. Many years later, when he worked as an animal-feed trader in Hamburg, he didn’t tell friends that he was Jewish and held his tongue when he heard them make anti-Semitic comments.

(“Ugh, this paper has another logistic regression with way too many variables for such a small data set. You’d think by now people would know, but NO!” “Sir, this is an Arby’s.”) If the joke has a point, it’s that the pressures of modern life — or at least Twitter — lead us to blurt out decontextualized tirades to anyone in the vicinity; that we’ve lost our ability, or willingness, to read the room.

And “Elementary” begins its final season on CBS.,"THE NAME OF THE ROSE 10 p.m. on SundanceTV. With “Game of Thrones” having heaved its last breath of dragon fire on  Sunday, many have been left looking for a new series to fill the sword-shaped void. One holier option is this medieval mystery mini-series, the adaptation of Umberto Eco’s best-known novel, “The Name of the Rose,” by the  Italian director Giacomo Battiato. The book, which came out in 1980,  sold millions of copies, and was the basis for a 1986 film adaptation with Sean Connery. The role Connery played, a Franciscan friar named William of Baskerville, is here played by John Turturro. The plot involves  mysterious deaths at a remote abbey. When the Connery movie came out, Vincent Canby said in his review for The New York Times that it had cut out the novel’s scholarly asides, which “cover everything from the political maneuvering within the Avignon papacy, the fight for the Holy Roman Empire and the church’s merciless suppression of heresies (Waldensian, Albigensian and Catharist, among others) to the invention of eyeglasses and gunpowder.” The mini-series format might make room for more of Eco’s embellishments onscreen.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/23/arts/television/whats-on-tv-thursday-the-name-of-the-rose-and-elementary.html

Gohar was born and raised in Cairo — where winters are mild, and summers come hot and quick — and makes a living creating interactive installations at fashion and art events (imagine, for example, cracking open a salt-baked pear with a wooden mallet at the recent Object & Thing design fair). Though she and her husband, Omar Sosa, one of the Barcelona-born co-founders of Apartamento magazine, have made a home for themselves in a cozy third-floor apartment on Spring Street in Manhattan, Gohar admits she still feels “very much like a foreigner” in the United States. Which is why, on a recent evening, she assembled some of her closest friends — including the fashion designer Maryam Nassir Zadeh, the actor and director Hailey Gates and the creative director Rafael Prieto — for dinner to celebrate an Egyptian holiday called Sham el-Nessim. The tradition, which means “smelling the breeze” in Arabic, is believed to be as old as the pharaohs, and celebrates the arrival of spring. Egyptians gather outdoors in public gardens, in zoos, in public spaces, on boats on the Nile and elsewhere, and feast on salted fermented fish, lettuce, beans and boiled eggs — all foods believed to be what was originally offered to the gods in ancient times. “In Cairo, it’s a really fun day,” explained Gohar. “There are people from all walks of life — it’s not a religious holiday — young and old, rich and poor, everyone celebrates the holiday.”",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/23/t-magazine/laila-gohar-dinner-party.html

There’s art history, in María Gainza’s autofiction about an Argentine critic; and literary history, in Casey Cep’s riveting account of the true-crime story that Harper Lee was never able to write; a fictional look back at Palestine in the early 1900s; and a nonfiction analysis of European history from 1950 until the age of Brexit. It’s a list that might appeal to the heroine of Binnie Kirshenbaum’s novel “Rabbits for Food,” were she not sidelined by a crippling depression: “Bunny’s range of interests,” Kirshenbaum writes early in the book, is “varied: history, politics, antiques, animal rights, psychology, fashion, and literature, serious literature, although now she is interested in nothing.” This novel isn’t about history per se, but that line — with its hint that we live at the edge of nihilism, and that all of our distractions are just so much scaffolding against the void — surely gets at one of history’s recurring themes, and one of the reasons we turn to it in the first place for edification and consolation: because we have survived so much (history tells us), and here we are.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/23/books/review/8-new-books-we-recommend-this-week.html

The brand’s distinctive packaging, Gilbert says, is like no other. The frosted glass bottles, ornately decorated tins and ceramic pots — filled with everything from rose-water toner to potpourri — are faithful to the company’s original vessels and emblazoned with its official seal (dated 1612, when the Dominican monks started selling their remedies to the public). “The design is beautiful and not at all pretentious,” says Gilbert, who often comes in after shoots to buy presents. “I love the fact that it’s not something new, but it’s been tried and true for years, in the old-fashioned way.”",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/30/t-magazine/old-fashioned-beauty-products.html

And Ava DuVernay’s mini-series about the Central Park Five debuts on Netflix.","DEADWOOD: THE MOVIE (2019) 8 p.m. on HBO. David Milch’s award-winning western series, which The New York Times recently named “one of the 20 best TV dramas since ‘The Sopranos,’” returns to HBO over a decade after the network unexpectedly holstered it. “Deadwood: The Movie” brings back most of the cast of the series, which includes Ian McShane as the hard-drinking saloon owner Al Swearengen and Timothy Olyphant as the darkly contemplative Sheriff Seth Bullock, but moves the action a decade later, with the town of Deadwood inching toward modernity. The result is “not just a nostalgic exercise but a fair shorthand of what might have transpired in a fourth season,” James Poniewozik wrote in his review for The Times. “It can’t, in its abbreviated run, recreate the series’s full glory, but it does offer that glory a wistful toast.” That’s more than most would have expected before plans for the movie were announced. Many fans of the canceled-too-early series until recently undoubtedly shared the view that Olyphant recently expressed to The Times: “I didn’t think it was ever going to happen.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/31/arts/television/whats-on-tv-friday-deadwood-the-movie-and-when-they-see-us.html
